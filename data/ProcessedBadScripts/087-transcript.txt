 Beverly Hills Chihauhau Script [dog barks] [ Gwen Stefani featuring Eve: Rich Girl] She's on her way. [woman] Good morning, Viv. Hello, Willow. Lovely to see you.  [woman] Here she comes!  [man] Is that the new Louis Vuitton? [man 2] I might've known she'd be the first. [woman 2] Fabulous bag. She's so chic. Sorry I'm late. We had to do a little shopping. Now that's the way to travel. I'm so jealous. Faboo! Louis Vuitton never looked so good. Mmm. Tell me the stones in that collar are not real. Aren't they gorgeous? Viv said I had to have it. [dogs barking]  Sorry keep you waiting.  Armand, it's fine. A brush and a seaweed wrap, but I need her by noon.  We're having lunch with my niece.  She'll be ready. I know, sweetheart. I'm going to miss you, too. You take good care of her.  No waxing, OK?  OK, no waxing for her. I hope she gives me a red bow. I want to look my best today.  Bimini has a date with Scooter.  Nice pedigree. Please! The dog chases parked cars.  He's crazier than a Labradoodle.  I give it a week, tops.  Hey! Talk to the paw.  [Chloe] Good for you, Bimini. It's not easy to find a mate with papers. Let alone one you could love. Me, I'd be happy with one who's not fixed. [chuckles]  [whistles]  [Chloe laughs] Down, boy. [ Kylie Minogue: Wow] [woman] All right, what's next?  What do you think?  Please. She wears Harry Winston. Viv? Fabulous. I'll take two. You should see Chloe. I'll need at least two days at corporate in New York to meet with buyers.  You have a little beret?  Perfection. [speaks Italian] Who needs sleep? It's Italy. Preppy little beauty.  This just came in.  She's allergic to wool. No.  Love that.  [Viv] Oh! Fabulous!  Viv.  I love it. And do you love it? You may have it. I'll get you anything you want. Yes, I will. No, not you, Patrick. Hello, Jackie O.  Love the smell of dirt in the morning.  Sam, the garden looks gorgeous. And I love the new designs for the waterfall that you did.  Thank you.  You're welcome. For everything. For giving me a chance to prove myself. Oh, good job, Papi. Very symmetrical. [Sam speaks Spanish] Ciao. Ciao, Papi. Yes, yes. We did it, Papi. Yes. Yes! Go on, take a break, Papi. You're doing great, buddy. Hello, beautiful. You're blocking my sun. Mi corazón, you shine much brighter than the sun Why won't you be my one  What's that smell?  Which one? The sweat of my labor or the mint patch I rolled in for you?  Neither.  Then it must be the fertilizer. Gross! You're covered in it. Of course. I am a landscaper. Grasshopper, mi corazón? I caught it myself. Very tasty. Papi, that's so disgusting. I see you're tempted. I'll leave it here in case you change your mind.  [doorbell rings]  Excuse me. We have guests. Guests? You got guests OK. You want to go have a drink later? There's a great puddle by the garage. OK, never mind. Aunt Viv! I'm here! [Chloe] An hour late, as usual.  Aunt Viv, hello!  [barking] How do you keep a job? Oh, that's right, you don't. Where's Aunt Viv? Where's Aunt Viv? Chloe, go find her.  Go on. Go find her.  Who am I, Lassie? You're so completely useless. Of course I understand. [Viv] It's just that I'm headed to Europe to promote my new cosmetic line. No, this is wonderful news. It's the best news. Yes, yes. OK. Wonderful. Bye.  Is everything OK, Aunt Viv?  I don't know what I'm going to do. I am getting on a plane at 4:00, and I gave the staff the week off and Chloe's dog nanny just had her baby three weeks early.  You're not taking Chloe with you?  No, no. Obviously if it was a vacation, of course, but this is a business trip. Four cities in ten days. She's much too delicate for that kind of travel. Plus she hates Berlin.  What about a kennel?  [Chloe] Kennel? No. No, no. I could never leave her in the hands of strangers. Never in a million years. But you're not a stranger.  What?  What? Here is Chloe's schedule. Try to stay to it as much as possible. I could skip the dog park on Wednesday because Chloe's friend, Stella, came down with fleas. I'm about to entrust you with my greatest treasure. Take good care. I love you, sweetheart. I love you so much. Mommy loves you so much. Byebye! Have fun, you two!  OK. Bye!  [doorbell rings] Playdate? [ Right Said Fred: I'm Too Sexy] Here you go. Good luck. [ball squeaking] [dogs barking] Don't worry, Chloe. Viv will be back before you know it. Rachel doesn't look so bad. You don't know the half of it. [girl] They all look so cute in their little outfits. You didn't have to dress her. She's so picky.  You're talking about a Chihuahua.  She's not any Chihuahua, Angela. She's a bossy, arrogant, manipulative, Beverly Hills Chihuahua. She has no direction. She can't keep a job. She's never on time. I'm going to be late to my appointments. Don't get me started on her schedule. Shiatsu massages, doggy birthday parties, couture fittings. I have to change her outfit four times a day. I mean, look at her. [both] She's so irresponsible. spoiled.  Woof.  [sighs]  I need to cool off.  Dive in, girl. Whoa! Hi, mami. Oh! Who is that hunk of Chihuahua over there?  [Bimini] Nice.  Mi corazón! The gardener. You are more lovely  than the dawn.  Wow. Mi corazón! You are more lovely than the dawn! So embarrassing. Maybe he'll go away. [speaks Spanish] I only Excuse me while I bravely defend your garden against that dangerous bird. Hey, bird! That is one hot dog. Excuse me. Coming through. Nice legs. Mud all over me. Hey, hey! Excuse me! Excuse me! Excuse me, señor? Gardener guy? Your dog is muy bad. Muy, muy, muy bad. Mucho naughty. [speaks Spanish] Can you get your doggieo out of here? Perdóname, por favor, but my heart must speak. I only wish to say that if you ever need someone to lick inside your ears or chew the hard to reach places or share your slumber in the sun I would be most honored to be that special someone.  Woof.  Put your tongue back in your mouth. Oh. I don't think so, Papi. You mean, not now. I mean not ever. I see. Of course. Well This thing. [speaks Spanish] Papi! [whistles] Duty calls! Please have a most wonderful day. Cool. Thanks a lot. [speaks Spanish] [barking] Rachel, wake up. I've got a manipedi at 11:00, and you have to make my waffles.  Get up!  [phone ringing] [crashing] [barking] Aunt Viv's.  Hi, Angela.  [dog toy squeaks] What? You're a genius. Yes, I can be ready in 30 minutes. OK, bye! Pack your swimsuit, Chloe. We're going on a trip. A trip? Ooh, where are we going? [girls] Mexico! Yeah! [ Buster Poindexter: Hot Hot Hot] I love this town!  Let's check it out.  Surfer boys, hi! Hi. I love this town! I could totally live here. Isn't this great? I'm starting to get the feeling there's no Four Seasons here. Whoo!  Third floor, baby.  Woo! Hello? Somebody forget something?  I'm walking by myself.  [Rachel] Chloe! I'm starving. What's taking them so long? Wait. What time are we supposed to meet the guys? Right now, at that club. Wait a minute. I forgot the name of the club.  Cayuca Club!  Right. Cayuca! Be right back.  Dinner time!  Finally. You should dance with Bryan, Rache.  I'm gonna dance with him.  He's cute! You'd better be making me either prime rib or reservations. There you go. You're joking, right? I am ready to dance all night! There's only one thing this is good for.  Try this on for size.  Come on, let's go! Chloe! That's a bad dog! That's a very bad dog! [Chloe whining] Rachel. What did you do to her? Nothing! She's faking! Let's go.  You silly girl.  She's so cute.  We should take her with us.  Yes! Take me out for food.  I'm not taking the dog dancing.  Cayuca! Hey! Wait! Come back here! Oops. Just add that to the bill. [both speak Spanish] Hello? Hola and adiós. You want to dance, Rachel? Let's dance. OK. Guy with a giant knife. Moving on. [people banging drums, playing music] If I wasn't starving, this might actually be fun. Oh! There you are. You are in so much troub Put me down! Who are you? Rachel, help me! Somebody, please. I'm being dognapped! [indistinct Spanish] Rachel!  So good night.  Seriously? No kiss? Chloe! Chloe, come out. I'm not kidding. I mean it. Stop hiding. Chloe? I'm sorry I gave you dog food. Chloe? I'll order you room service for breakfast in the morning!  Chloe?  What's up, love bug? Chloe's missing. I don't know where she would go. She doesn't like to walk anywhere,  let alone run.  Well  What?  Las peleas de perros were in town. Dogfights. They're criminals. Always on the move. How do I find them? I have heard rumors. Mexico City? Then there's nothing more you can do. You've done everything you can. Why don't you go put your suit on and join us? I'm going to keep looking for Chloe. And if I can't find her, I'm going to Mexico City. Rache [Rachel] Chloe! [dogs barking] Where am I? You're in the dogfights. Dogfights? What? This is outrageous. I was born to shop, not fight. Unless it's at a sales rack.  Quit whining, princesa.  Chloe Winthrop Ashe does not whine. [Speaks Spanish] A delusional Chihuahua. You won't get any sympathy from Delgado, señorita. He's a gladiator. A gladiator? You know. A fighter. Delgado is the best of the best. Don't listen to Rafa, chica. El Diablo's the meanest dog in the fights. Word is they fought once before, and Delgado did not come out on top. [praying in Spanish] What's he saying? Ay, bendito, he always prays before a fight. Don't you speak any Spanish, chica? The name's Chloe, not chica. And why would I speak Spanish?  Hello! You're a Chihuahua, mi hija!  So? I'm from Beverly Hills. You know, 90210, the shopping capital of the world? She's a gringa from California. That's right. The only reason I'm here is because I was stolen.  You think I volunteered for this?  [Chloe] But I'm an heiress.  A hairless?  No, an heiress.  I have a trust fund.  Look. If you're worth something, they'll ransom you. And if they ransom you, they won't fight you.  Guess you have nothing to worry about.  Well, that's a relief. I am so glad you feel better. Now can we get a little quiet? I can't wait until Viv finds out what Rachel's done. Mi corazón, I think of you day and night [sniffing] Hold your tacos. These scents are old. [Sam] Papi? Time to go home! Where is she? Where is my Chloe? Whoa! What's going on? [barks] Hey, Papi, come on. Let's go.  Hi. Hola.  Hi. I'm Rachel's friend, and you're the gardener, right?  I'm Sam.  Your garden is muy bonita. And when I get a casa, I'm so calling you to be my gardener  because it's  Thank you very much.  Where's Rachel?  Forget her, dude. Where's Chloe? And what are you hiding there? Chloe's lost in Mexico. Rachel stayed to find her. The love of my life is out there in trouble? She wants me to email this to her in Mexico City. So [speaks Spanish] [ George Thorogood and The Destroyers: Bad To The Bone] Señoras y señores! You know him, you love him. El campeón, El Diablo! Oh. It's about time someone's upgrading my accommodations. And now, the challenger. Weighing in at a whopping six pounds. I give you ChiChihuahua! Hey! [laughter] Thank you. Thank you. You're too kind, really. This is so much nicer than that stinky corral. Oh! I'm sorry. I thought I was alone.  Mister  They call me El Diablo. It's certainly nice to meet you. Clearly I'm in the wrong place. So perhaps we could speak to the concierge or someone. Stop talking! You know, I've got a dentist who could do something about that yellowing.  What?  I get the idea that teeth  are important in your line of work.  You don't like my smile?  [barking]  Watch it! Say it, don't spray it!  [mumbling] What am I going to do?  Sounds like he's closing in. Dog that size? Won't be much left of her. [mumbling] Gringa, gringa. She's adiós. She's byebye. Poor little hairless. [praying in Spanish] OK, that's it. Delgado? What are you doing? Huh?  What's going on?  Where are you going?  How do you do that?  Bro, give me the combination!  Yeah, save us!  Save us, Delgado!  Don't leave us!  Come back! This is highly inappropriate. Hey, hey, hey! That's cashmere! Ow!  Vámonos!  Hasta la byebye! Let go before it rips. I know it's rude to leave early, but I really must be going now. The show's over for you, chica. You know, "dog eat dog" is just an expression!  Not this time, Diablo!  Delgado!  Move it!  OK. You'll pay for this, Delgado! I'll find you! [indistinct chattering] Wait, wait! Slow down, you guys! Slow down!  What's wrong?  I told you, it wasn't my fault! Where'd the dogs go? Go, go! [Vasquez] I want that Chihuahua! [barking] [indistinct Spanish]  [Chloe] English, please!  [Delgado] Move it! Let's go!  This way! This way!  OK. [speaks Spanish] [panting]  My bootie!  Your what?  My bootie!  Forget it!  Forget it?  Forget it!  The Chihuahua!  That's Italian leather, mister! [Chloe] Look out! Go! Go! One at a time! [Chloe] Hey! Wait a minute! You won't fit! I got it! Oh, no. I lost another bootie. I am sure I locked those cages, sir. I want that Chihuahua! Why? She's worth something. [Vasquez] Judging by the diamonds around her neck, it's a lot. Look out.  [upbeat mariachi music]  [cheering] What is all of this? [Spanish] The Day of the Dead. This is so beautiful. It's what humans do to honor their ancestors. It keeps them alive in their hearts. Helps them remember who they are, where they came from. Wow!  You're my dog!  Delgado, gracias, bro.  I'm out of here!  I'll see ya, kid. Wait! Wait Delgado! [Chloe] "See ya?" That's it? Number one rule of the streets, princesa. Every dog for himself. Now, get lost. My name is not "Princesa." It's Chloe. And I am lost. And I want to be found. [Spanish] Look, princesa I mean look, kid. I got my own problems. I can't go back to the fights. I got to get out of town.  How does Beverly Hills sound?  Too far. Come on! If you could figure out a way back, you could live with us on our estate. If you haven't noticed, I'm a little large for a lapdog. But you're the perfect size for a guard dog. Our old one Papi, he ran off. You had a guard dog named Papi? [mumbles in Spanish]  What hotel you staying in?  You'll do it? Answer the question before I change my mind! I don't know the name, but believe me, it was no Carthay Hotel. The Carthay? There's one here. Would they know you? They should. We're preferred guests. We have a gold card. Why me? Of all the dogs in Mexico. Why me? All I need, Chihuahua with booties. This'll be fun! You'll see. Here's the GPS. We're hot. Diablo, you go get me that Chihuahua. Go! Go! [dog howling]  Hold up a second.  Uh What's that sound?  Hmm. Hold your breath.  [Chloe shrieks]  What did you do that for?  El Diablo's got your scent. Of course he does. It's Chanel No. 5.  Congratulations.  Now I've lost another bootie  and I stink.  I don't smell anything. Are you kidding? I smell like a wet dog. You are a wet dog. [police siren]  Look señorita  Ashe. Ashe. I'm sorry. We're already trying to stop the fights. And we don't have time to look for every lost dog in Mexico. This is not just any dog. This is my Aunt Viv's dog. Chloe means everything to her. I'll tell you what. Go back to your hotel, download that photo you were telling me about and I will see what I can do.  Gracias.  You're welcome! [Mexican Hat Dance ringtone]  Hi, Aunt Viv.  Ciao, Rachel. Yes, Capri's fantastic. I was trying the house earlier. I was worried because nobody was there. Yeah, we went out for Mexican. Could I talk to her just a second? Um I'll put her on. [imitates barking] Hi, baby! How's my little baby? [continues barking] I miss you, too! I miss you, too! [more barking] OK, here you are, Your Highness. Carthay Hotel. [sighs] I feel like I'm home already!  Thank you, Delgado. Thank you!  All in a day's work. But maybe you should wait out here.  Yeah, whatever.  I don't mean it like it sounds, but they can be a little particular about the dogs they let in. Knock yourself out. We'll be eating gourmet food in no time.  Bienvenidos al Hotel Carthay.  [Chloe] Thank you. Excuse me. Would you be so kind as to look at my collar? You'll find my owner's name and number. [barking] Tshh! Get out! Hello! Ew! It touched me! Get this mutt out of here.  Mutt? How dare you!  [concierge] Edgar! I've been a preferred customer at this hotel for years! Don't you dare!  I'm sorry.  You are making a big mistake. Huge. Really! [shrieks] Oh, no. I'm I'm hideous. What's taking her so long? Hmm. Figures. What did I expect de una princesa? Delgado, it was so humiliating. You won't believe Delgado? Delgado. [ Megan McCauley: Porcelain Doll] [bells jingling] Excuse me. I'm here to see Detective Ramirez. Detective Ramirez is already with someone, señorita. Five minutes, please. [door buzzes] Psst. Don't look now, Hannah Montana, three o'clock. What are you doing here? I mean, qué are you doing here? Isn't it obvious? To find Chloe. Angela told me everything. Why did you pretend you couldn't speak English? I didn't. You just assumed. Thought you'd let me go along and make a fool of myself? Didn't need any help with that. What makes you think I need help from a gardener? Oh, no, she didn't. It's not that I have a problem with that word, but, actually, I am a landscaper. And I'm not here for you. I'm here for Vivian, because she's like family to me. [clears throat] I emailed a description of the dog's collar to all our stations. Chloe's collar. It's worth a fortune. You're welcome. Maybe a picture of the collar might be even more helpful. Yeah, a lot. Gracias. So what should we do now? We? Nothing. You go back to your hotel and wait. Please. He's right. There's nothing you can do. What? We're Mexican, not Mexican't! I'm not going to stop looking. He only cares about the collar. I need the dog. I'm with her, amigo. My Chloe's in trouble. Hey! Papi! Hey!  Come on, fool. Let's go!  Papi, where're you going? [ Tag Team: Whoomp]
