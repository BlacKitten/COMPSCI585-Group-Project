How dirty!  I wonder if he's dead.  The American troops will be arriving soon.  It would be an embarrassment if they find such a guy here at the station. VOICE       Mommy! SEITA       What date is it?   Setsuko WORKER 1     Again  Hm?  What's this? WORKER 2    Let it be, let it be.  [ALT: Forget it, forget it.]   just throw it away.

SETSUKO     I don't like the airraid shelter SEITA       Saying such a silly thing [ALT: What a silly thing to say.]  You could be blown up by the bombs.

The shelter behind the fire station.  She said it could withstand the direct hit of a 250 kilo bomb.  There's no need to worry.  Mom's probably at the Nihon Matsu Station.  We arranged to meet there.  Let's go there after we rest a while. SEITA       Are you all right? SETSUKO     I lost my sandal. SEITA       I'll buy you a new one, a much better one.

I'm glad that ours just burned, clean and simple. MAN         It's really a good thing that you're all right. WOMAN       [?] MAN         No, it's not Aunty. SETSUKO     Niichan, I need to go!

SETSUKO     Okay. WOMAN       Seitasan.   Seitasan, have you seen your mother?  She's hurt.  Hurry, go see her.  I'll watch her.  It was scary, wasn't it, Settchan.  You didn't cry ? SETSUKO     No. WOMAN       Your brother has some business.  It won't be so long. MAN         Ah, Seitakun.  We were looking for you.  Are you all right? SEITA       My mom? MAN         This way.   Oh This is your mother's. SEITA       What? MAN         Over here. MAN         She's finally gone to sleep.  It would be better if she was placed in a hospital.  I'm having people ask around.  I heard that Kaisei hospital in Nishinomiya didn't burn. SEITA       Ahm  Mom has a bad heart.  [ALT: heart trouble]  Is there any way could you get her the medicine for that? MAN         I'll ask around.  Well, I'll come again. SEITA       Mom WOMAN       Did you see her? SEITA       Yes WOMAN       It's really a pity. SETSUKO     I'm thirsty.

SETSUKO     Look!  Niichan's [ALT: Brother's, I'm] good at this.  MAN1        We can't take off the bandage.  It's better not to look at the body. MAN2        With this heat MAN1        We have to use trucks starting today. MAN3        Your sister  What did you do with her? SEITA       I left her with our distant relative in Nishinomiya.  We had arrangements for us to stay there in case we got burned out . MAN3        Is that so?  That's good.  Well, I have duties, so I'll leave you here.  Take care.  [LT: Be well.]  SETSUKO     Mommy!  Where's Mommy?  Is Mommy still not well? SEITA       No.  She got hurt in the raid. AUNT        Welcome back.  How was your mother?  Is she in the Kaisei Hospital? SETNA       Uh yes AUNT        Marines are lucky.  They get to use trucks for transport in their preevacuation.  ["Sokai" = preevacuation of items or persons to rural areas by those living in more metropolitan areas]  Your spare futons are out in the room. SEITA       Thank you.

[ALT: So, go to sleep now.] SETSUKO     Okay.  AUNT         herring, dried fish flakes, dried sweet potatoes, eggs, and pickled plums.  My!  Isn't this butter?  Even during these hard times, some people have it all.   the military people get to live in luxury.  [ALT: get to live in excess.]  So Seitasan, have you visited the hospital?  I want to discuss with your mother about what to do in the future, so I was planning to visit her with Settchan.  She didn't make it? SEITA       Mom died at the school. AUNT        What?  She died?  If that was the case, why didn't you tell me sooner?  You're an unfrank child!  ["Mizukusai" = not being frank out of reservation or from politeness] SEITA       I didn't want Setsuko to know. AUNT        So she died  My goodness.  You must write to your father immediately and let him know. SETSUKO     Niichan!  Sister bought me a new sandals! SEITA       That's good, Setsuko.  [ALT: Aren't you lucky, Setsuko.] GIRL        Welcome back.  [Note: In those days, especially in the rural areas, not everyone had bathing facilities.  Neighbors borrowed from those who did have them.] VOICE       Rough time for you kids SEITA       Thank you very much. SETSUKO     What's that sound? SEITA       That's the  edible frog.  There's nothing to fear. SETSUKO     Ah!  A firefly! SEITA        Here, take this.  [ALT: catch it.]  Oh, you crushed it! SETSUKO     What is this smell? SEITA       It's because you squished it! SEITA       My, there're so many of them; the fireflies.  Oh yes. Setsuko, close your eyes and say "Ahhhn". SETSUKO     Why? SEITA       It doesn't matter why.  Just say "Ahhhn". SETSUKO     Ahhhn. SETSUKO     A drop!  Mmmmm!  Drop, drop, drop!  [ET: candy; "Dorop" which comes from drop candy is synonymous to "Ame" = candy, in Japanese.] SETSUKO     I almost swallowed it!  SEITA       We're back. AUNT        That was long.  [ALT: You're back late.]  Did you thank the lady?  [Note: In Japanese, "Obasan" is not only "aunt" but is also used in reference to any middle aged woman.] SEITA       Yes. SEITA       That looked good  AUNT        Seitasan.  What happened to school?  Don't you need to go? [ALT: Shouldn't you attend?] SEITA       Well, the academy I used to go is a mess from the bombings, and the school burned, so there's nothing I can do. AUNT        Really?  [ALT: Is that so?]  You did write that letter to your father, ? SEITA       I did .  As a certified mail. AUNT        When? SEITA       It was as soon as I got here, so it's been more than 10 days. AUNT        That's strange.  I haven't received any reply yet.   If you use the scissors you must put them away, Settchan.  AUNT        How goes the war? BOY         It's getting worse, I heard.  Other factories have to cover the load for those others burned in the airraid.  All they keep saying is for us to pour all efforts into increasing the production in preparation for the battle on the mainland. [ALT: They tell us to pour all efforts into increasing the production in preparation for the final battle.] AUNT        That must be so  Even the distribution of food items are getting worse and worse.  [ALT: Food rations are getting sparser as well.]  It's becoming tough for everyone, and not just for the soldiers on the battle field.  Koisan is also part of the country's work force; you must eat alot and gain strength as well. [ALT: keep up your energy/strength] ["Koisan" = Youngest sister in rural 'Kansai' tongue] AUNT        Again! WOMEN       So at your place, two got burned out?  That must be hard. They're so young.  Pity. SEITA       What's the matter?  Your rash itches? SETSUKO     I'm hot!  I hate shelters! SEITA       Bear it.  Niichan's here, so you're not afraid, are you? [ALT: I'm here, so you're not afraid, are you?]  SEITA       Wanna go to the sea? SETSUKO     Yes, let's go.  Let's go to the sea! SEITA       My They've turned everything into  fields SETSUKO     What are they doing? SEITA       They're taking the salt water.  The rationed salts and soy sauces aren't enough.  Let's go.  Hurry and get undressed. SETSUKO     Ohhh! SEITA       It might be a little cold. SETSUKO     Noo!  [ALT: Don't!]  It's cold! SEITA       Doesn't if feel good around the rash? SETSUKO     Yes!  It's a large bath tub! SEITA       Hey!   Stop!  [ALT: Wait]  I'll eat you up! SETSUKO     What's the matter?  [ALT: What's he doing?]  He's lying down. SEITA       You don't have to see that.  When it gets a little warmer, we can swim; I'll teach you how. SETSUKO     If you swim, you'll grow hungry!  [ALT: If we swim, we'll grow hungry] VOICE       "If you swim, you'll grow hungry!"  [ALT: *as above*] MOTHER      Seitasan,  Settchan.  Come over here.  You must be hungry. The carupisu is chilled, too.  [Carupisu = a sweet milkbased drink] GIRL        Oh, Mother!  Were you safe?  It's great you came. WOMAN       How are you? GIRL        I'm fine.  Everybody cared for me. SETSUKO     I'm hungry. SEITA       Bear it.  Hurry, or else the raid's  gonna come here soon. SETSUKO     I'm tired.   Niichan, piggyback!  VOICE       Take shelter!  AUNT        About your mother's kimono I hate to say it, but since there's no more use for them, why don't you exchange them for rice?  I myself have been bartering [="itemitem exchange"] a little at a time for some time to supplement .  I think this would be about one toh .  ["toh" = about 16 qt.] SEITA       One toh?! AUNT        You must get more nourishments.  You're going to grow strong and be a soldier, right? SEITA       This would be one toh ? AUNT        I'm sure your mother would be pleased about it, rather than have these just lie about.  Well, I'll be going. SETSUKO     You can't. AUNT        Why, Settchan, you were awake? SETSUKO     It's  Mom's .  You can't!  It's Mom's.  You can't, you can't! SEITA       Setsuko! SETSUKO     No, no, no!  No, no, no! AUNT        Isn't it a good rice?  I'll be cooking this white rice for dinner,  Settchan.   Here, you two hold on to this. SEITA       It's white rice,  Setsuko!  [ET: A white meal, Setsuko!] AUNT        There you go.  It's a pity that both Koisan and Niisan are working overtime and won't be able to eat this warm meal. SEITA       The white rice is sure delicious, isn't it? SETSUKO      Seconds! AUNT        Yes, yes.  Settchan, you have an appetite when it's white rice, don't you? SETSUKO     Yes!   I like it! SEITA       What's the matter? SETSUKO     I don't like  zo^ sui.  ["zo^ sui"=watered barley/rice meal] SEITA       The pickled plums that I brought  There're no more? AUNT        That thing  You know that it ran out a long time ago.   Here, your lunch. BOY         Thanks.  [LT: Then, I'll be taking it.] AUNT        Gokurohsama  [LT: Thanks for the labor/toil; ALT: Have a good day.] GIRL        Well, I'll be going! AUNT        Take care! SEITA       Look.  Lunch will be white rice, so bear it and eat it. AUNT        Cut it out!  For those that are here during the day, lunch will also be zohsui!  Why should the lunch for those that work for the country and those that just sit around all day be the same?  Seitasan.  You're old enough; start thinking about how you can be of help.  You two don't give us any rice but expect to eat it.  It just doesn't go that way.  No way. You let them eat white rice for a while and my, they become so picky about taste.  [ALT: picky about food] SETSUKO     But that rice is our rice  [ALT: But it's our rice.] AUNT        What was that?  Are you saying that I'm cheating you, then? What a thing to say!  What's the use of taking in two orphans, if they say such things to me?  [ALT: Why should I bother to take in two orphans, if they]  Fine!  Let's cook separate meals from now on.  You won't have any complaint, then.  And Seitasan.  You do have other relatives in Tokyo, don't you?  There's that someone from your mother's family. Why don't you send out a letter?  Nishinomiya [ALT: This place] might be bombed any day . SEITA       But I don't know their addresses  GIRL        Let's go home! WOMAN       Yes.  Dad's waiting at home, isn't he? BOTH        The frogs are croaking, so let's go home [NOTED EARLIER: The reason for frog in this song: "Kaeru" = frog; "kaeru"= to go home/back; "kaero^" = let's go home/back] SEITA       Sorry! [LT: Forgive me!] I had to wait a long time.  What's the matter? SETSUKO     I'm hungry.  I'm thirsty. SEITA       All right. [ ALT: Understood] Here.  Lick these  drops.  Mom had seven thousand yen saved in the bank.  Seven thousand yen!  If there's that much, we can manage plenty. There's no need to worry anymore. SEITA       I'm writing to Dad, saying "Give us a reply,  Setsuko's waiting." OWNER       You guys are lucky.  In times like these, no matter how much money you offer, you can't buy these items.  Nowadays, there're no items to sell and the business is dry. Especially metal products.  Can't find them anywhere. SEITA       I'll take that comb, and do you have any umbrellas? OWNER       I don't have umbrellas Oh yes. SEITA       "Rain, rain, fall, fall, Niichan has come with an umbrella.  Pittchi Pittchi Chappu Chappu [the sounds of rain close to "splatter splatter droppity drop"] Lan Lan Lan!"  SEITA       Isn't Niichan good with this? SETSUKO     Yup. AUNT        Careful with the fire. SEITA       Okay. BOY         What happened to those two? AUNT        They say they're going to cook for themselves from now on. BOY         Really That's admirable.   second, please. GIRL        Mother, didn't you say something harsh again? AUNT        Well, but, not a single word of apology and they went and bought all those utensils.  It's as if they're insinuating something! SEITA       I'm filled!  [ALT: I'm full!]  ["Gossosan" = short for "Gochiso^ sama"; said after meals to indicate gratefulness or contentment with the meal] SETSUKO     [?: That's not proper, Niichan.] SEITA       It's okay.  You don't have to sit so properly.  MAN         There.  That's the rationed portion for two. SEITA       Only this much? MAN         Yup.  The next ration will probably be in July.  SEITA        sweet? SETSUKO     Ahhh!   There're lots of flavors! SEITA       Grapes, strawberries, melons, mints.  They're all in there, aren't they?  Setsuko, you can drink 'em all. SETSUKO     Whew!  I drank 'em all!  AUNT        My, my!  They went to sleep without cleaning up ! They do as they like.  They really aren't cute at all!  [ALT: They're not likable at all!] AUNT        Again!! SETSUKO     Mommy!  Mommy! AUNT        Seitasan!  Koisan [= younger sister] and Niisan [= older brother] are both working for our country, so why don't you at least try not to make her cry?  [ALT: so why don't you at least make an effort to stop her crying?]  We're already losing sleep from the  sirens every night.  We can't sleep with this racket! SETSUKO     Mommy!  Mommy! VOICE       Emergency war status, emergency war status.  The enemy is approaching from the northern direction AUNT'S VC   Seitasan, you're going to the shelterhole, again?  ["yoko ana" = LT: Side Hole; A hole dug into the side of a mountain for airraid shelter]  At your age, shouldn't you be [ALT: isn't it natural for you to be] helping the fireprevention program of the community group? SETSUKO     I want to go home.  I don't want to stay at aunt's anymore. SEITA       The house got burnt.  We can't go home anymore. BOTH        Higher than the roof, the KoiNobori.  The large koi is the father and  [NOTE:  KoiNobori = a colorful conelike flag in the shape of carps that is displayed outside on the national holiday, Children's Day] AUNT        Stop it!  What a thing to do in time of war?  I'm the one who will be scorned!  How senseless!  [ALT: How irrational!] Really, what burden have been tossed my way!  [LT: Really, what godof misfortune has wandered in!]   Even during the airraid, you're never of any use  If you value your life that much, you should live in the shelterhole! SEITA       Hey  Do you want to make this our home?  No one would come here and the structure is solid.  We can do as we please. SETSUKO     Is it okay to make it our home? SEITA       Yup.  [ALT would be a broken "yes": yeah, nhmph, ahhuh]  SEITA       We've overstayed our welcome.  [LT: We've interrupted you for a very long time.]  We'll be moving elsewhere. AUNT         elsewhere?   where are you going? SEITA       I don't know for certain, yet. AUNT        Well, be careful  Settchan, goodbye. SETSUKO     Here's the kitchen!  Here's the front door!  Where's the toilet? SEITA       It doesn't matter where.   I'll be going with you. SEITA       Thank you. MAN         Just leave it around there.

My mouth is watering! SEITA       I'm hungry! SEITA       If it could be caught, we can eat that   [ALT: It's supposed to be edible if we only could catch it] SETSUKO     The frog? SEITA       I heard it's good. SETSUKO     SEITA       Setsuko, forget the rest and get inside the net.  [ALT: I'll do the rest so get inside the net.] SEITA       What's the matter? SETSUKO     I forgot my toothbrush. SEITA       It doesn't matter if you don't do it for a day. SEITA       Hey, you'll be bitten by the mosquitos.  You should be in the net. SETSUKO     It's so dark, I'm scared.  [ALT: It's all dark and I'm scared.] SEITA       I'm going to go to the bathroom, but do you want to go too? SETSUKO     Yes. SEITA       That's the "special attack" unit.  [ALT: suicide unit.  Men in the "Tokkohtai" never returned alive.] SETSUKO     Really?  They look like fireflies. SEITA       I guess so.  Hey  Do you want to capture fireflies? SETSUKO     Ah!  I see your face. SEITA       Your face, too.   A hair ornament! SEITA       All right!  Firefly's light, window's snow!  [Note: Part of a poem/song describing the changing season] SEITA       Before you were born, I once saw a shipnaming ceremony [?:  shipopening?? "kankai ceremony"]. SETSUKO     A shipnaming ceremony? SEITA       Yup.  Dad got on board the front of the ship [?].  The combined fleets were all there. SEITA       Enemy ships attacking!  Bababababa!  Babababa!  [Noise associated with firing machine guns]   I wonder where Dad's fighting the war SETSUKO     You're suffocating me, Niichan!  SEITA       What are you doing? SETSUKO     I'm making a grave.  Mommy's in a grave, too, right?  I heard it from Aunty.   Mommy died, too, and she's in a grave. SEITA       Let's someday visit her grave.  Maybe you remember  [LT: Setsuko, do you remember?]  You've been to the graveyard near the Inofuki [?], right?  She's  there  Mother is  under the big camphor tree SETSUKO     Why do the fireflies die so quickly?  BOY1        What's this?  Someone's living in a place like this.

It's worse than our ricesoup! BOY         A ghost!   SEITA       And  we've traded all of  Mom's kimono for rice and don't have anymore.  From your place, we've purchased many things with money before MAN         I'm not talking about kimono or money.  Though we're a farm, we don't make enough to distribute it to others all the time.

MAN         You little bastard.  Come on.  Stand up!   What's this?  You pulled up even the small potatoes.  You must have been the one who has been stealing from the farms around here!

[ALT: Then, I trust you'll take care of the rest.] POLICE      I heard that today's airraid was unexpected.  Well, why don't you take a drink of water from the back? SEITA       Setsuko! SETSUKO     Niichan! SETSUKO     Niichan   Where does it hurt?  That's not good. We'll have to call the doctor and have him give you a shot. SEITA       Setsuko!

SETSUKO     Brother went to the mountain for firewood.  Grandmother went to [Note: This is the famous beginning sentences to the children's story "Momotaro".

DOCTOR      It's a prostration due to malnutrition.  Her diarreah is the result of that.  Okay, next person! SEITA       Some medicine or shots? SETSUKO     I don't like shots.

SETSUKO     Ice cream  And I want to eat drops again. [Note: During the war, food items were rare and the variety scarce.  The fact that she knows about them and expresses that she wants to eat them indicates that she has eaten them regularly and shows how welloff her family actually was.] SEITA       Drops, huh?   Alright!  I'll go withdraw all the savings. I'll  bring back all that you wanted to eat. SETSUKO     I don't want anything.  Just stay here,  Niichan.  Don't go. Don't go.  Please don't go.

SETSUKO     Here you go, Niichan SEITA       What's this, Setsuko? SETSUKO     It's a meal.  I'll give you the the cooked okara.

I didn't steal it .  Here, watermelon. SETSUKO     It's delicious SEITA       Wait a moment.  I'll cook you a riceporridge with eggs immediately.  I'll leave the watermelon here.  Okay? SETSUKO     Niichan  Thank you R/ SEITA    After that, Setsuko never opened her eyes again.  MAN         Here.  The one sack of coal, special delivery.  [ALT: one bale]  If it's a child, you should borrow the burning ground from the temple.  You take her clothes off and if you light the fire with soybean skin, it'll burn nicely.  But what nice weather! [Note: Do not think this man to be insensitive.  Everyone has been desensitized to some degree during the war.  It is truly sad that a child's death is nothing new or anything sensational.]  GIRLS       My, it hasn't changed at all!  Home is definitely great! [ALT: There's no place like home!]  It's been a while; the record player!!  Familiar sights! SETSUKO     Hurry home!  R/ SEITA    The following morning, I placed the remnants of Setuko's bones that were like a fragment of a jewel into the drop can and left the mountain, never returning to the shelterhole. R/ SETSUKO  Niichan R/ SEITA    It's late, so sleep now.  [ALT: It's late, so go to sleep now.] R/ SETSUKO  Okay.  THE END [If I may add my opinion here, the strongest message of this film comes when Seita's rei stares out at us.  I heard "Look at what war does to people.  Please don't ever repeat what happened again.  War is not glorious nor honorable.  We just wanted to live more"] ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: MESSAGE: Translating takes lots of time and money.

ANGEL'S EGG synopsis [this is the review as posted to the Miyazaki list; it was later printed in the July 1992 issue of Anime Hasshin's THE ROSE.] Subject:      Angel's Egg, a quick walkthru. Date:         Sun, 22 Dec 1991 13:40:00 CST Source:       Hayao Miyazaki Discussion Group  From:         "Bryan C. Wilkinson"  Pardon any errors, this is a directfrommemory interpretation, and some of the order may be wrong. But the essential premise of the film should be clear enough. Snatches of this are remembered also from Miyako Graham's translation of a plot description released to Animage from the studio. Oshii Mamoru's Angel's Egg   Prologue: A Boy watches the Sun set into the Sea.  The Sun is portrayed as mechanicallooking red orbshaped piece of architecture emitting light from an eyeshaped window of stained glass. The upper surface of the Sun is covered with statues. A great deal of steam, causing a sirenlike pitch, vents off as it sinks below the water, and darkness begins to permeate the seascape.  The Boy appears to be on the edge of his twenties, which edge is not cleat.  He bears a weapon on his shoulder in the shape of a crucifix, and sometimes bandages may be visible on his hands. Not a living soul does he see, nor does one see him. The Planetarium: A Girl awakens.  Her bed is in the ruin of a planetarium, in the center of a damaged model of the Solar System.  With her, under her blankets, is an Egg.  She envelops the egg in her skirt, and hides it under her blouse, giving her the look of being pregnant, and hurries from her abode. The City of Fish: The Girl sets about the task of filling flasks with water. She first does this at a lake.  The lake is fed by a stream, though, which leads her to an empty city. The city's architecture bears stone gargoyles in the image of Fish, as is the form of its fountains.  Inside one house we peer at her from, a wheel can be seen, the kind used to steer old ships.  She visits a house with many flasks, and inspects them carefully. The Arrival: A long, long line of organic looking tanks rumble into the city.  They stop, and the Boy, with his weapon, emerges from one.  They then continue and leave. The Girl is unsure of this new arrival, and runs away.  She hides in a ruin, and checks the Egg. But the Boy has followed her, and questions her what she thinks is in it.  The Girl doesn't trust him, and tries to leave.  But he persists in following her and questioning her. He seems to already know things she doesn't.  But all she responds with is "Who ARE you?"  This he does not answer. The Fish: As the two wander the city, a horde of faceless fishermen run through the city.  We seeeverywherethe shadows of many great Fish, on the streets, the buildings, everywhere.  The pursuers try to harpoon the shadows, and their spears merely bounce off stone or shatter windows and lamps. The Opera House: In the ruin of a great cathedrallike opera house, the two look at a damamged stainglass window of a Fish.  The Girl speaks of a Dream she had, where the Egg was in a Tree and inside the Egg was an Angelor was it a great Bird?  She's not sure.  The Boy has suggested that one must break an Egg to know what it hides, and this thought is what scares the Girl the most.  She knows where there is a picture of the Tree, and takes him to see. Fossil of an Angel: She takes him to a ruin, which seems to be a great skeleton. In the walls, the floor, and the stairs of the ruin are giant fossils of giant fish and birds.  Lining the walls are hundreds of flasks, all filled with water.  She takes him to a wall, and we see an old carving of a Tree.  He is shocked. He has seen such a Tree before, but it was very long ago. He then relates a story, one of a great flood that was to last forty days and nights.  She takes him up the stairs, and his surprise is even greater.  Imbedded in the wall, like the famous fossil of the prehistoric bird archeopterex, is the skeleton of a winged humanoid. The Impregnation: Back at the planetarium, the Girl sleeps, and the Boy stares at the Egg.  He reaches a decision, and raises his weapon above the Egg The Girl awakens.  The Egg is not with her, and the Boy is gone.  She climbs out of bed and sees the floor. She screams. Before her, is a blasted open shell. As for INSIDE it There was nothing inside the Egg. It is getting less dark.  The fishermen stand still statues?as the tide rises and the buildings begin to disappear beneath the water. The Girl flees from her home, and runs towards a large crack in the earth.  She plunges from the cliff, and slowly falls towards a reflection of herself.  Then, she is drownning, and hundreds of bubbles erupt from her lungs.  The bubbles rise to the surface Simultaneously, Trees bearing bubblelike Eggs erupt from the ground's surface. Epilogue: The Boy watches again, as the Sun rises from the water.  Among the statues, is one of the Girl. Feathers swirl around him in the air. He stands on the beach alonenever did he see a soul, nor did one see him.  We then slowly, slowly pull away into the sky, until most of the island becomes visblethe island is a great Ark, and it is without motion. Sorry if I screwed the order and such up a little, it's been a while since I've seen it.  I remember bits of Miyako Graham's translated article, so that helped.

TITLE:  Angel's Egg Directed by:  Mamoru Oshii Character Designs by:  Yoshitaka Amano Screenplay by:  Mamoru Oshii [we see a day in the strange life of ANGEL] [WARRIOR gives Egg to ANGEL] W:      Keep precious things inside you or you will lose them. W:      What do you think is inside that egg? A:      I can't tell you things like that besides, I don't even know who you are. W:      You have to break an egg if you are to know what's inside. A:      Who are you?! [ANGEL runs away] A:      Don't follow me! [later] A:      The fish have come out. W:      Fish? A:      Even though they aren't anywhere, they chase after them. Even though there aren't any fish anywhere. [after the Fish hunt] A:      Please my egg don't do anything to it promise. [ANGEL leads WARRIOR into a building] A:      This way. [In front of a stylized basrelief of a Tree.] W:      I've seen a tree like this somewhere when was it?  So long ago that I've forgotten under a sky where the clouds made sounds as they moved.  The black horizon swelled and from it grew a huge tree.  It sucked the life from the ground and its pulsing branches reached up, as if to grasp something the giant bird sleeping within an egg. A:      What happened to the bird?  Where is it? W:      He's still there, still dreaming. A:      Dreaming?  What kind of dream does the bird dream? W:      What's in the egg?  You still cannot tell me? [ANGEL leads WARRIOR up a staircase lined with Water bottles] W:      Since when have you been here? As many days as there are bottles? W:      I too have forgotten where I'm from Maybe I didn't know from the beginning where I am going. A:      Will you be going away? [WARRIOR starts quoting] W:      "I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the ground, man and beast and creeping things and birds of the air, for I am sorry that I have made them.  I will send rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights, and every living thing that I have made I will blot out from the face of the ground. And after seven days the waters of the flood came upon the earth.  On that day all the fountains of the great deep burst forth, and the windows of the heavens were opened.  And rain fell upon the earth forty days and forty nights.  The ark floated on the face of the waters, and all flesh died that moved upon the earth.  Birds, cattle, beasts, all swarming creatures that swarm upon the earth, and every man.  Only Noah was left, and those that were with him in the ark.  Then he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters had subsided from the face of the ground.  Then he waited another seven days, and sent forth the dove, and she did not return to him any more." W:      Where did the bird land?  Or maybe it weakened and was swallowed by the waters, no one could know.  So the people waited for her return, and waited and grew tired of waiting. They forgot they had released the bird, even forgot there was a bird and a world sunken under water.  They forgot where they had come from, how long they had been there, and where they were going so long ago that the animals have turned to stone.  The bird I saw, I can't even remember where or when, it was so long ago.  Perhaps it was a dream.  Maybe you and I and the fish exist only in the memory of a person who is gone.  Maybe no one really exists and it is only raining outside.  Maybe the bird never existed at all. A:      It exists.  It's here. [ANGEL leads WARRIOR around] A:      It's here.  It's here. [WARRIOR encounters the fossilized Bird] A:      I found it, it's already turned to stone, it's in here.  I'm going to hatch it and put it back.  It's the bird I found. W:      I know that.  I thought so. [ANGEL is listening to the Egg] W:      Can you hear something? A:      I can hear it.  The sound of soft breathing. W:      That's your breathing. A:      I can hear the sound of wings.  It must be dreaming of flying in the sky. W:      That's just the sound of the wind outside. [ANGEL talks to the Egg] A:      Very soon right now you're in here dreaming but soon I will show you very soon so you must stay here now.  It doesn't rain here where it's warm. [WARRIOR puts ANGEL in Bed] A:      Who are you? W:      Who are you?

A clock flies by.] Man:    "You scared me!" Clock:    "It's 12:40.  Return to your work." Man:    "Ok, ok." [The Man walks down a path.] Man:     "I have a secret." [The Man goes into a workshop and sees a girl robot sitting on a desk.] Man:    "Of course, this is a secret for my family." [He brings some tools.] Man:    "I never had the love of a mother.  I understand why I needed to get married so badly  I desperately wanted femininity in my wife" [He touches the girl robot.  One gets the sense that he is not entirely happy with being married to a wife who is an aggressive career woman.] [As the man walks down the street, he sees some people leaving a bar. Various robot body parts are left dumped in a nearby trash can.] [Back in the workshop, the girl robot starts moving.] Girl:    "I don't have a name." Man:    "Meow." Girl:    "I think I want to fall in love." Man:    "What are you saying?  I don't remember programming such a word into you!" Girl:    "You are lonely, aren't you?" Man:    "What happened to you?" Girl:    "I could hear and I could feel." "You are still a little boy, aren't you?" [Man picks up flying saucer toy.] Man:    "I'm surprised that you recognize your own consciousness." [Girl jumps on desk.] Man:    "Huh?" Girl:    "Don't be surprised." Man:    "You shouldn't step into my life." Girl:    "Why do I exist?" "I'd like to be closer to you." Man:    "Does a machine feel pain?" "There are no robot 'groupies'!" "Does a machine have a personality?" Girl:    "But I know myself very well." "I want to experience lots of love, by my own choice!" Girl:    "Hm.  You are wearing a cynical smile." [As the man walks away, the girl robot grabs him.  Surprised, he throws her against a wall.  As she bleeds, he grabs a wrench] [Now many years in the future, he sits in a chair outside a house. His now grownup daughter and grandaughter approach.] Man:    "Are you leaving already?" Daughter: "Yes, father.  Next time, three of us will come. Please take care of my mother.  Now say goodbye to grandpa." Granddaughter:    "See you next time, grandpa!  Next time, please make me a toy." Man:    "Be careful on the way home." Granddaughter:    "Bye bye!" [The wind starts to blow.  Suddenly, the man sees a vision of the girl robot.] Girl:    "I was waiting for a prince" Man:    "I couldn't be your protector."  [The vision disappears.  The Man returns to the workshop to view the longdecayed body] [Now even further in the future, the man is again sitting outside the house.  The wind starts blowing.] Wife:    "Grandpa, grandpa, the wind is starting to blow [so you should come inside]." Wife:    "Ok grandpa, you're not a little boy anymore, so you should listen to what I say!" Wife:    "Grandpa?" [The girl and the man walk off together and vanish.  A toy angel hovers in front of the camera.] Notes:  Apparently in Japanese, "feminist" can mean either a person who promotes equal rights for women, or it can mean an effeminate man.  Literally, "I couldn't be your 'longlegged Uncle.'"  If anyone knows the story that this comes from, please let me know! =============== Starlight Angel =============== In the future, Tokyo Disneyland is still "the Happiest place in the World!"  Especially for a "robot" who falls in love with one of the visitors ===== Cloud ===== A lonely robot walks by as the sky fills with different types of clouds. Not much of a plot, but it is beautiful to watch ======================================================================= Extraordinary Meiji machine stories: A story of a Western man attacking  ======================================================================= Set in the early Meiji period, this film is a hilarious spoof of Japanese 'giant robot' films!  The villain speaks English, and the Japanese defenders speak Japanese.  Therefore, this script will only summarize the villain's lines The cast of this film is: American  John Jack Orkafin     The evil scientist villain Japanese  Sankichi    The leader with the headband Yayoi        The girl Fukuda        The kid with the glasses Daimaru        The big guy who works the engine Genjiro        The thin guy who steers the machine To make this easier to follow, I will label their parts as: Villain, Leader, Girl, Glasses, Big Guy and Thin Guy. [The film opens with the town's population running for their lives as the Villain's robot smashes through the town.  The title appears, and the Villain happily announces his plans for world domination.  Note that he has Marco Polo's book describing the Far East!] Leader:    "That damn thing!  I'm going to get even!" "Are you ready?" Girl:    "Yes, but can we move this without permission?" Glasses: "Won't all those people in the neighborhood get mad at us?" Leader:    "You idiot!  This is a national crisis!" "Daimaru, shove a lot of coals in the furnace!" Big Guy: "Ok!" Leader:    "Genjiro, wake up!" Thin Guy: "Ok." Leader:    "Go!" [The Japanese robot rises up to challenge the invader] Villain: Eh? [The Leader begins a long speech from the top of his machine.] Leader:    "Hey you big slob, stop right there!  You are the nasty one disturbing the order in this peaceful time after the opening of our country [to the West]!  For the upcoming festival, all of the people in the neighborhood built this machine.  It is not the most technologically advanced, but I, Sankichi Komajo, will not let you advance one more step from that spot!  I'm going to destroy you, so get ready!"  [He disappears down a hatch] Leader:    "Forward!" "Genjiro, raise the right leg!" [The robot punts a nearby house] Leader: "Move it more carefully!" [Meanwhile, the Villain starts getting furious] Glasses: "Someone is coming out [of the Villain's machine]!" Leader:    "What?  Genjiro, stop!" [He looks through a telescope] Leader:    "Oh, let's see, ah" [Sees the Villain and his cannon!] Leader:    "It's a foreigner!  It's a foreigner!  What should I do?" Glasses: "Calm down!  Calm down!" [The Villain begins a long speech through a megaphone, giving them 3 seconds to surrender before he blows them up.] Leader:    "What is he saying?" Glasses: [Thumbing through book] "I understand English, but I'm not that familiar with American!" [Villain shoots a cannonball] Villian: "Eh?" Thin Guy: "Ah!" Leader: "Daimaru, they are firing the big cannon, so come upstairs!" Big Guy: "All right!" [The Villain aims and shoots again, hitting the Japanese robot. The girl screams.] Girl:    "Wha?" Leader:    "Damn, he hit us!" Girl:    "What's going on?" Leader: "Be quiet!  Just be patient!" Girl:    "What do you mean, 'Be quiet'?" [Daimaru makes it up to the top of the machine] Big Guy: "I'm here!  [Sees the tube]  Isn't that the big fireworks?" Leader: "Yeah, but I made some changes to it" [The Villain cleans his cannon while Sankichi aims his] Leader & Big Guy: "Ok, here it goes, look up!" [Fires and hits the Villain's machine] Leader & Big Guy: "All right!  Ah?  The inside of the machine is made of brick?" [The Villain fires another shot that hits the Japanese machine] Thin Guy: [Mumbles something] Big Guy: "What are we going to do, Sankichi?" Leader:    "Ok, hit the guy who is standing on the shoulder of that thing!" Big Guy: "But if we hit, that guy will be killed!" Leader: "That's ok, just shoot!" [They shoot but hit the head of the Villain's robot instead.  The Villain starts laughing until the shot sets off his storage of ammo] Leader:    "Yeah!" Big Guy: "Of course, we were aiming for the head to being with!" Leader: "Oh no we weren't" "Now we're going to tear down that machine!" [The Villain rants some more] Girl:    "Now we should stop fighting!" Leader:    "Huh?" Girl:    "If we keep fighting, we'll destroy the whole neighborhood!" Leader:    "Don't make a fuss!  This is important!" Girl:    "What did you say, you pinhead?" Leader:    "Pinhead?" Glasses: "Pinhead!" Girl:    "If you don't like pinhead, how about peabrain, dunce, moron"  Leader:    [gets irritated] Glasses: "Since the last hit we took, something's not working right!" Leader: "Shut up!  Be quiet!" Girl:    "Someone who is so headstrong is called 'bullheaded'!"  Leader:    "Ah?" Girl:    "Don't act like you're so brave!  You don't have any brains!  Why don't you learn to read or write? A monkey is smarter than you are!" Leader:    "You have a really mean personality!" Girl:    [Sticks her tongue at him] [The kid with glasses rides some gears to get to another part of the machine.  He yells, "Sankichi," then by accident sees under the girl's kimono.] Glasses: "Sorry!" Girl:    [Kicks a shoe in his face] [Meanwhile the Villain discovers he's out of battery power.] Big Guy: "Hey Sankichi, we ran out of coals!" Leader: "Don't worry, just peel off and burn any available wood!" [The Villain recharges his batteries.  It takes until sunset before the two machines advance far enough to reach each other.] Leader: "We finally got here" [The Villain rants some more and raises the right arm of his machine] Leader: "Raise the right arm!" [The kid with glasses raises the Japanese robot's right arm] Leader: "That's good!  Raise the left hand and grab his arm!" Girl:    "What are you going to do?" Leader: "We're going to grab and throw him!" Girl:    "I grabbed it!" Leader:    "Hold on tight!  Are you ok?" Glasses: "Yes, I'm ok!" Leader: "Daimaru, grab onto something!" [Daimaru clings for dear life] Leader: [To pilot] "Is everything ok?" "Good!  Raise the left leg and twist!" [The robot starts spinning] Leader: "Go!" [The Japanese machine throws the Villain's machine into the river, but the Japanese machine also falls.  The Villain's robot causes a minature wave that washes out a bridge and the spectators on it  The kid with glasses views the destruction.] Glasses: "Oh my town!  My neighborhood!" Leader: "We won!" Thin Guy: "I'm not so sure about that" Big Guy: "Yeah" Girl:    "But we did a lot" Leader:    "Hey look, that's a Japanese sunrise!" [Sky fills with an oldstyle 'Rising Sun' emblem] Girl:    "No, that's sunset." [Emblem abruptly disappears] Leader:    "Oh." Girl:    [Laughs]  "Sorry!" Leader:    "Anyway, that battle is over.  We fought off the foreigner with our own hands.  But since I saved the peace in this town" [Sankichi puts his arm on the girl's shoulder.  She responds by stomping on his foot] [And the Villain paddles off into the sunset, making plans for next time]
