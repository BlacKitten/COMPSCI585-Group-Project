Has it come on?
No
Now?
No
Now?
No
Now
Turn the damn thing properly
Welcome to the wrestling area
at the Seoul Olympics
Looking forward to an exciting match today
It's come on
Shall I come down?
No
The final match this Olympics in the 72 kilo category
Between wrestlers from Russia and America
It's really sad that
Despite wrestling being
such a popular sport in India
Indian wrestlers have dissapointed in the Olympics
Even our boys
can bring home medals.
But where is the support?
Neither money,
nor facilities
How will our boys win a medal
If a medal could be won with words
you would have won
it a long time ago
Are you new here?
That's what I thought
Try stepping into a
wrestling arena someday
you'll run for your life
before the match behins
Looks like you
have done it many times
Run for you life
If this were an arena,
Then we'd see who would run
Who needs an arena?
The stage is set for a big fight
Excitement in the air
Both wrestlers are ready
You are absolutely right, Tom
Looks like it's going
to be an interesting bout.
Handshake
Whistle and begins
He's down!
He's down
An early thrashing
Overconfidence can
prove fatal
Bro, one more?
Next round.
Ya, Tom. doesn't look as easy as it seemed
Both testing eachother
A great attack,
superb defense!
Amazing move
Didn't know what hit him
Here's an attack
And the counter
It's over
David has become Goliath!
Top class wrestling
You're good
You've just defeated
a state level champion
Don't be disheartened
You've just lost to
a national level champion
Meet my uncle
Mahavir Singh Phogat
He quit wrestling many
years ago
:- 
There you go
Merely building a good body
does not make a wrestler
Come here, kid
Wrestling runs in blood
you have to be born with it
Buy yourself some milk
Bless you
When there's no food on your plate
what will you eat? Medals?
No one gives a damn
about wrestling
Just take up the job you are being offered
Why did you quit?
I had no choice
Wrestling game me respect, fame
but couldn't give me money
So I took up this job
Every wrestler dreams
of bringing honor and
glory to the country
But if the country offers no support
How far can a wrestler go
It's not your fault that you
couldn't win a medal for your country
How long will you let these
memories depress you?
What I couldn't do
our son will
He will win gold for our country
Our flag will fly the highest
Mark my words
That day uncle was as
anxious as a student
Don't worry brother
Semua akan baik-baik saja.
It's a girl
Uncle was hoping for a boy
But a girl was born
It's ok
You have a sister now, Omkar
I was genuinely happy
But uncle was faking it
And it all started
Suddenly everyone was an expert
in the art on conceiving a boy
Feed black cow sweets made
with white sesame seeds,
Wrapped in maize flatbreads,
with yourleft hand before sunrise
A son for sure!
A special prayer for a son
Recite daily
Here... eat this
Eat this
Stop, will you
Mahavir.
Make sure you only try on a Sunday
Other days, reign in your urges
Got it
People didn't stop giving
their advice
Here you go, son
Day of delivery arrived
and so did half the village.
.To take credit for a son
Geeta, you are going to
have a brother
You can play with him
It's a girl
But uncle didn't get a son
Nor the villagers, credit
But, in all these,
unfailing techniques
where did the fault lie
She must have fed a black buffalo
instead of a cow
Else look at my cousin
from Rohtak
She had three boys
in three years
If you say the prayer in reverse
the results will also be reversed
Self control is a virtue
I told him to try on Sundays
He must have let
the reins free every day
I couldn't give you a son...
It's not your fault
Don't get me wrong
Both Geeta and Babita
are very dear to me
But only a boy
can fulfil my dream
Years went by
Uncle remained adament.
he wanted a boy
But maybe God was adamant too
The third child was a girl
and so was the fourth
This time I too was dejected
Food is ready papa
Turn it over or it'll burn
After that he gave up on his
desire for a son, and his dream too
Hey Mahavir Singh!!
What's wrong with him?
No you carry on
Hey Mahavir!
I've been blessed with a boy
Have some sweets
What happened?
Look how badly
they've been thrased
Say something!
Yes look how badly,
they've been thrased
They're all swollen and bruised
Yes
Stupid boy
I didn't uncle
Geeta and Babita beat them up
They started it
He called me a loser
and Babita a witch
So, we beat the shit out of them
They beat them so badly?
For such a trivial reason?
Yes, shouldn't have
beaten them so badly
Please forgive them...
they're kids.
We are forgiving it because
they are your girls
Move!
Got thrashed by girls!
Come here
Come here!
We won't fight again papa
First tell me, how did you
manage to do it
First he called me a loser
but I remained quiet
But then he called Babita a witch
I grabbed him and
punched him like this
Then the other guy attacked
I grabbed his hair
and shoved him down
and dug my elbow in his back
They say a twig is enough
to give hope to a drowning man
Here, uncle had found
not one but two lifeguards
So he could win a gold for the country
From now on Geeta and Babita
will do no household chores
Wrestling is in their blood
From now they will only wrestle
Wrestling is for boys
You think our girls are
any lesser than boys?
I've never seen girls wrestle
What will the villagers say?
For how lomg will they talk
What if the girls break
their arms and legs
We'll fix them
Where will the money come from
I don't know
Don't ruin the girls' lives
for your passion
Let me try for a year
For this one year
you bury your feelings
If I'm proven wrong
I'll bury my dream forever
Be ready at 5am tomorrow!
Why papa?
I want to feed you
your favourite snack
5am? Okay?
What did you do now?
I thought you did something
Eat
How is it?
It's not really spicy, papa
Alright make it spicier
Eat as much as you want right now
Because from today you will both
lead the life of a wrestler
Haaah??!!
And wrestlers are not allowed
pickled, oily and spicy food
in fact, all the food that you love
Consider this your last treat
Papa, it's difficult to run
in these clothes
Don't you dare stop!
Nobody would've ever been
punished so severely
for beating up a couple of boys
He abused me
Why did you have to beat him
Now you tell me!
We'll obey your
every command mummy
Just save us
from this wrestling
Forone year forget
that you have a mother
Hey, forgot so quickly?
How utterly absurd
Girls in the wrestling arena?
Will you have me sin at this age?
Babita....
Will you press my legs please?
I was going to ask you
the same thing
Always respect Mother Earth
The more you respect it
the more respect
you will get in return
Uncle had managed to bring
Geeta and Babita to the wrestling pit
But something was missing.
In order for Geeta and
Babita to train well
They needed to practice
with good wrestlers
Omkar?
Him?
Yes
Isn't that to much, brother?
It was bad enough that
you were making the girls wrestle
Now you want
them to fight boys?
Yes or no?
I don't have the heart to say yes
And, I don't have the courage
to say no
Okay, send him over
Because of you both
I'm caught in the crossfiree
Stop complaining!
You are just caught
in the crossfire
We've been pushed into a war
Keep running!
Why has papa got him
to train with us
This pint sized boy is no challenge
He look like a TTSS to me
What does that mean?
Tall on talk, Short on Strength
'TTSS'... is it?
Go easy, I'm your little sister
Ya...ya!
Don't mind me saying
but your girls are a little weak
Want to fight me?
I'll be right back
I don't understand your ways
At one time, I can either be
their coach or their father
When the coach is at work
The father has to take the backseat
Sorry for calling you TTSS
Sorry, my foot
You think this is a joke?
He is throwing you down
and you are letting him?
When he attacks from the left
why don't you stabilize yourself
on the left and defend
Sorry papa
Child, this is wrestling
three sorrys and the game is over
Come on
Where's the strength in you?
You are training the girls to wrestle
I didn't say anything
But I will not allow you to cook
chicken in my kitchen
Try and understand
Wrestlers require protein
I don't care!
If meat is cooked in my kitchen
I will stop eating
You want your girls
to be weak wrestlers?
I don't know anything
There's no way chicken will be
cooked in my kitchen!
Omkar!
- Ya.
Do you know how to cook?
No
We don't have enough money
for their current diet
How can we afford
chicken now?
What? Sell you chicken worth
100 for 20
And I will benefit from this deal?
Why don't you explain
Geeta and Babita will be
famous wrestlers
And when people find out that
they eat chicken from your shop
where do you think
they'll buy chicken from?
That makes sense
But just 20?
There's other shops
How about 40
I won't give any more
than 25
I've browned the onions
This pot will not go
back in my kitchen
Now put the chicken in the pot
And cook slowly
To be eaten with rice
But can also be eaten with bread
Uncle was fulfilling his duty
and the villagers theirs
Girls are best suited
for the kitchen
not for wrestling
Not mad,
He's getting the girls to
wear shorts and fight boys
Since you all started wrestling
your walk has become very manly
Wonder what else will happen?
Next, it'll be my fist
in your face
If only you had
given birth to a boy
Their mother doesn't protest either
The entire village is laughing at us
Who will marry our girls?
I will make our girls so capable
that boys will not choose them
they will choose boys
I'm going to tell papa today,
this wrestling isn't working out
Me too
B-O-Y... boy.
C-A-T... cat.
Papa, this wrestling
isn't working out
for Babita.
Ya, Papa... and
Geeta gets so tired
that she falls asleep in class
She can't concentrate in her studies at all
Babita's body aches terribly
She keeps tossing and turning
all night
Girls tease Geeta
by calling her a man
Sad, isn't it?
None of these
seem like a problem
Tell me if there is
a real problem
Read
Papa, our hair is getting ruined
because of wrestling in the mud
She even has lice
I killed eight this evening
Now, that's a real problem
Okay, be ready tomorrow at 5am
Papa, please
We dont have any problem
In fact, we're enjoying it
Please don't cut our hair
We will do as you say
Ma, say something
Lihat apa yang Papa lakukan.
Please don't cut our hair, papa
We'll do whatever you say
We'll wake up in the morning
Do everything
won't ever complain
Just don't cut our hair, please
Please, papa
Cut it
Cut it?
Bisakah kau menumbuhkannya?
Cut it
Getting them to wrestle
was okay
but it's cruel to chop their hair off!
They are girls, after all
Whatever I'm doing
is for the best
Anything that distracts them
from wrestling
I will get rid of
Is that the full moon or the sun!
I'm confued, today both seem
to have risen together
Let it go, Babita
Our stars are to blame
Enough of wrestling
now, it's time for a street-fight"
And then, in a small village
of Haryana call Balali.
a grand rebellion began
Geeta and Babita
Verses dictator Mahavir Singh.
All of uncle's arsenal
were neutralized one by one
First the alarm clock
What happened, papa?
You are late today
Age is catching up
No problem
We've finished today's training
Come, Babita.
Countless light bulbs were martyred
How come the bulb blows everyday?
Quality... papa
Injury was made an ally.
Surrender was given without a fight.
Should I give it to you?
And uncle, despite having both hands
felt helpless like the armless character
from the film 'Sholay'
Get out of here!
I couldn't understand how
I had suddenly become so strong
But uncle understood very well
why Geeta and Babita become very weak.
Geeta and Babita thought
that they had won the war
Hey
Are you going to Sunita's wedding?
M...Mama..
Are you trying to embarrass me?
Choose one
This one
Let me see
Finally my girls are looking like girls
Don't tell papa
Come home before 8pm
Let it go brother
He is crazy
We missed training
just for a day
What was the need to create
such a big scene
What kind of father forces
his daughters to become wrestlers
Makes them wake up at 5am to run
Works them like slaves
Makes them fight boys
And if they protest
he cuts their hair
May God never give
anyone such a father
I wish God had given me
such a father
At least your father
thinks about you
Otherwise, our reality is
the moment a girl is born
teach her to cook and clean,
make her do
all the household chores
And once she turns 14
marry her off
Get rid of the burden
And hand her over to a man,
... whom she has never met
Make her bear children
and raise them
That's all she's good for.
At least your father
considers you his child
He is fighting against
the whole world
He is silently tolerating
their taunts
Why?
So that the two of you
can have a future... a life
What is he doing wrong?
That day one fact
became clear to me
Don't know about Geeta and Babita
but I sure didn't have
wrestling in my blood
Look at him sulk
Give him some butter, ma
He's become so weak
I lost intentionally to
make you happy
Get lost.... TTSS
Lost intentionally...
Don't worry
Ini hanya diantara kita.
After all, you are family
Your reputation is ours, too
Don't get so cocky
You won't be able to tomorrow
No, uncle. Tomorrow I will
definitely put up a tough fight
We are going
to Rohtak tomorrow
For a competition
But, I am not ready for
a wrestling competition yet
Who is talking about you?
She will fight boys?
She won't last
two minutes, uncle
Why?
She thrashed you
Aren't you a boy?
I had seen a lot of wrestling
competitions in my life
But today I was going to
witness a bout,
the likes of which, had never
been seen before in Haryana
A riot was inevitable
Mahavir Singh Phogat...
Welcome!
It's an honor that you have come
to watch the competition
I've got a wrestler with me too
Name?
Geeta Kumari Phogat.
What?
Geeta Kumari Phogat.
You'll make a girl wrestle?
Yes, so?
Write
Sir. the day I organize
a cooking competition
that day bring Geeta
This is a wrestling competition!
We have come very far
We won't return without a fight
Either Geeta will fight
or you and I
First, you utter nonsense,
and then you are being stubborn too
What do you mean?
You want a girl
to wrestle with boys
You may not be bothered
about your honor, but we are
I will have your honor
laid out now
Please... sir
Please... we really respect you, sir
But what you ask for,
can't happen
We can't do this brother
Let's go
How dare he...
You are getting a chance to
play the game
and you are giving a walkover?
Meaning?
How many years have we been
holding wrestling competitions?
Five
How many people come to see?
Just a handful
So?
Dimwit, think about it
In a town that has never
seen a girl wrestle
when a girl wrestles a boy,
how many people
do you think will come to watch
Our competition will go
through the roof
But what if the girl
breaks her arms or legs?
You bandage
your broken competition
Even if you charge
2 rupees per ticket
your wrestlers will eat for months
Mahavir-ji!
Ladies and gentlemen
boys and girls
You must have a girl
walk on fire, eat a snake
But today, for the first time
in the history of Rohtak
see a girl wrestling a boy
in a competition
in half an hour, at Lal Chowk
Tickets - two rupees,
A wrestling girl for two rupees!
You have to win!
Even if you were to pit
your boys against a lion,
there still wouldn't have been
such a crowd
What do you think?
How many seconds
will she last?
Mate, by the time you finish
she'll be done and dusted
Will she fight in trunks like these?
Get lost!
I was just hoping
Where is she?
She looks hot
Hope her t-shirt doesn't tear
I hope it does!
Go, Geeta!
Her father has lost it!
Do you know
the rules of mud wrestling?
Then choose who you
want to lose to
Who do you think she'll pick?
Our scrawny spider
He will win for the first time
Gosh, Jassi will beat her to a pulp!
Three of you, out of here
Your girl has lost it
There is still time, stop her
Or she'll go back on a stretcher
Before you fight a bout
you have to fight fear
At least my girl has conquered fear
Go easy, she's a girl
Don't make that mistake
Will you embarrass us?
Geeta, great going!
W..Wow!
She's gone
What a save!
You fought well
Excellent
The committee away
the winning wrestler. Jassi
wish a cash prize of 20 rupees
and from our patron, Kartar Singh,
a special prize for
Geeta Kumari of 50 rupees!
Sorry, papa
It's ok
Come on
You got lucky, or you'd have
gone home on a stretcher
Papa.
when is the next fight?
From tomrrow you'll have to
bless her as well
Once again people had started
talking about Geeta and Babita
These two girls come from Balali
and thrash boys
This fellow lost to a girl
Why didn't you fight her?
But this time the heckles were
replaced with applause
Some did not want to
wrestle with the girls
And some didn't allow
them to wrestle
Please leave!
Geeta and Babita were winning
not just competitions
but hearts to
14.900.. 15.000... 15.150.
You've become a senior wrestler
By getting selected to the
Haryana state team
Geet Kumari has brought fame
to not only our school but to the district
And we are sure that she will make
us proud in the Nationals, too
Leave, For two months?
Is your daughter getting married?
I have to prepare
Geeta for the Nationals
Forget about it
If she was getting married
I might have considered
I don't understand your decisions
I didn't have a choice
I couldn't let go of my dream
so, I let go of my job
What will you do now?
I'll start farming
on our own plot of land
It's hard work,
but at least I will be able
to give the girls time
Titu... put this in the car
Wait.... go
Yes Mahavir, what
are you saying?
If I could get some funds
it would help a lot
My girl has now reached
the state level
So
What is the big deal
in reaching state level?
That too in ladies wrestling?
Your daughter ran alone,
and came first
What do you need the funds for?
Sir, I want to buy a mat
for her to train on
She's playing well
If you support her today
then one day she will
make the nation proud
Look, Mahvir Singh...
we get this much
funding for sports
Wrestling gets this much
Keep aside gents wrestling
then remove coaching, dieting,
traveling, equipment etc
All that remains for ladies wrestling
is this much
And for this much,
you bought me a box of sweets
But you have our
complete support
The reason India
doesn't win medals,
is because officers like you
are warming these seats
Alright I'll get up
Titu, serve me lunch
Mahavir Singh, care
to join me for lunch?
The federation is a breeding ground
for such termites
They have ruined sports
There is no support
for sports persons
Medalists dont grow on trees
you have to nurture them
With love, with hard work,
with passion
And here, the scoundrels don't
give money for even a mat
What is a mat, brother?
Synthetic mattresses
on which wrestlers fight
A mattress is a mattress!
No?
Did I say something wrong?
Uncle had already ruined
our sleep, figuratively speaking
Now hewas hell bent
on doing it lierally, too
Wrestling on a mat is different
from mud-wrestling
Now we have to wrestle
on the mat
And in mat-wrestling
you have to score points
You can score 1,2,3 or 5
points
Omkar..
If you hold the opponent
by the waist,
and drop him to his knees
then you score one point
And from the ground position
if you roll him on to his back
then you score two points
There are different ways
to do this
Uncle!
Like this
Or from the ground position
like this!
If you flip your opponent on his back
from a standing position
then you will score three points
Please, uncle
Like this.. three points
Like this... from standing position...
on to his back
To score five points is difficult
but it can be done
if you flip your opponent
from a standing position
above you head
in a rainbow-like arc
and have him fall on his back
then you score five points!
Watch
Come here
No please
A real wrestling mat is not like this
It's like this
We have to fight
in the yellow area
The red zone is a danger area
If you step out of it,
you lose a point
There are three rounds
of two minutes each
Whoever wins two out of
three rounds, wins the match
Sir, your daughter is underweight
So?
Take my advice
Go back
Feed her
Fatten her and
come back next year
If she fights like this
she will break her bones
You just tell me whether
she is allowed to wrestle or not
Yes.. she is
Sign up
"Sub-Junior Nationals"
Good move!
Geeta had defeated beefy boys
how long could these girls survive?
Is that a girl or a storm?
"Sub Junior National Champion"
"Junior Nationals"
Is she underweight?
"Junior Nationals"
Is she underweight?
Yes... but how does it matter?
"Junior National Champion"
Time flew by...
Geeta went from junior to senior
And uncle...
from senior to senior-citizen.
Go...Geeta.
Babita and I, went from shorts
to full length pants
Push.... push her down
Side throw!
Geetaaa!!!!
Victoryto Haryana!
"National Champion"
Finally uncle's dream
has been achieved
Now we can all relax
No
My dream remains to be fulfilled
Every year sees
a National Champion
My dream will be fulfilled
when you win gold
not for yourself
but for your country
You can celebrate today
From tomorrow we start
preparing further
Papa...
Need to speak to you
Tell me
Papa,
Now that I am a
National Champion, so
So?
No I mean
All National champions
need to go to Patiala
for further training
To the National Sports Acadamy
What are you getting at
Tell me
I will have to go too, papa
From now, I'll have to train there
under the national coach
"National Sports Academy"
Geeta Kumari Phogat.
Wrestling
Geeta Kumari...
This place looks good
Let's hope the coach is good too
Girls, come on
You all must be rejoicing
at the thought of
advanced training
Well, forget about learning
first you have to learn to forget
Forgetthe wrong training
you've received
Wrong diet, wrong exercise,
wrong technique
And after forgetting all that
your real training will begin
With Nation Coach,
Pramod Kadam.
And you will only learn
what I teach you
Is that clear?
Yes sir!
Is that clear?
Yes sir!
Good
Warm up
Get me tea!
Come on girls
Energy, more energy
Yes, that's the way
Good
Sir, I'm Mahavir Singh Phogat.
Geeta's father
Ok
I'm the one who has trained her
Yes... good
She's good
Very strong, with a lot of stamina
Where's my tea
Come on.... move it!
Sir... one request
If Geeta gets the right coaching
she will definitely win
an international medal
Geeta!
There should be a 90 degree
angle between your calf and thigh
Who has taught you?
Is this how you will win
an international medal?
You came to drop her off, right?
You've done that
Now leave the rest to me
Don't waste my time!
Shall we go out later tonight?
Just one won't make a difference
Yes that's the way!
Remember one mistake
can cost you the medal
Yes papa, training is going well
I'm going
Coach-sir is waiting
Bye!
Geeta!
Come here
Forget your papa's technique
Learn only what I teach you
Hello!
Sorry Geeta has gone out
For years I have been losing
to both of you intentionally
It's is the truth!
That's it!
You see?
Wrestlers shine only when
the technique is right
Win the nationals soon
you too will be here
Yes.... when are you coming home?
I'm coming next week
Need something?
Nothing. You get here
Ok
Did you like it?
Really?
You grew out your hair
It's looking good
Your papa won't like it
Now everything can't work
the way papa wants
Coach-sir didn't say anything
You do as you please over there
Just be a little careful here
real training happens
with a lot of freedom
Not with so many restrictions
We watch movies,
television, eat out too
My performance hasn't suffered
I am the topmost wrestler
at the NSA
You home wrestler?
How are you?
I am fine papa
How's your training going?
She's going to Sydney for a fight
How's your training going?
It's going very well papa
You've seen...
I'm learning a lot of new things
New strategy, moves, technique
very good
I have thought that
I will teach her some things, too
After all, she too has to
win the Nationals
You've grown your hair
Papa..
- No
It's good
Don't just attack
you need to defend too
Hold me
Now how will you free yourself?
Hold this way break and attack
That's an old technique
Let me
Hold me
Tight
Push your thumbs in this way
Not in the front... but to the side
Break and attack
What's wrong with my technique
What's wrong?
No papa. It's not wrong
This is more correct
Coach-sir has taught it
So now you are an expert
International?
Papa, I was....
I'dlike to know, what is it that
your coach-sir has taught you
that your father couldn't
Not her, show me
Come on
Push your thumbs in this way...
So, this is what your coach-sir
has taught you!
Is this how you'll win
an international medal?
I wasn't ready papa
So, get ready
This is what I was saying, papa
Isn't there a difference?
What happened today
wasn't right
What wasn't right?
This was bound to happen
Someone had to tell papa
that his techniques are weak
His techniques aren't weak
He's become a little weak
And don't forget that
you've won the Nationals
based on his "weak" techniques
You can win the Nationals
with these techniques, Babita
not international matches
And the sooner
you realize this, the better
Alight
You keep faith in your techniques
I pray to God that you fight
well at the Nationals
And I pray that you do well
in your international tournament
"World Championship Sydney"
"National Games, New Delhi"
Go.. Babita!
Throw her
What are you doing Geeta
What are you doing, Geeta?
Attack
Good one
Is this how you defend?
The next round,
play attacking
You don't look happy, papa
Didn't I fight properly?
No, my dear
You fought exactly as I expected
But I never imagined Geeta
would fight like this
And now, you too
have won the Nationals
You too, will go to NSA
You'll have a new coach
And your papa once again
will become old
No, papa
Never forget
how you got here
Hey, champion
Hello, sis
Still upset?
Come
What did you fill in the bag?
Let me get it
It's so heavy
Hey, Jasmeet!
This is my younger sister, Babita
Wow! A family of wrestlers
Here is the mess
This is where we eat
This is the lounge
Where we watch TV
Where is the training center?
My, aren't you eager!
You can see it tomorrow
Rest today
Can I say something?
Don't feel offended
Tell me
I've changed a lot
Remember the first time
you lost a match
You couldn't sleep all night
And now, in spite of losing an
international fight you are....
I mean, it doesn't show
at all on your face
Has papa told you
to say this?
I remember papa's training
very well
You focus on your training
I will manage mine
And why are you lecturing me?
I've only lost one match
'Moscow'
Geeta Kumariis trailing
in the second round as well
She's fought well
but hasn't managed much
Geeta tries
but Kasha scores one point
And that's it
Geeta Kumari makes an early exit
from the world championship
What a dissapointment
Yet another defeat for
Geeta Kumari Phogat
In Jakarta too, Geeta exits
in the first round
A humiliating defeat for Geeta
in the Instanbul World Championship
Geeta, don't lose hope
We've worked very hard
And you played well
You just couldn't win
It doesn't mean you are
a bad wrestler
It happens
Some people are not made
for international victory
Do you feel too,
that I'm not cut out
for an international medal
I don't know about that
All I know,
is that you are the girl
who thrased boys in mud wrestling
You are the girl who in spite
of being underweight won sub juniors
You beat everyone at the Nationals
for three straight years
If you are not cut out
for international victory
then I don't know
which girl in India is
I have a lot of faith in you
but it's nothing compared to
the faith that papa has in you
Talk to him
How do I face him?
He's our papa
At worst, what will happen?
He will give you an earful
Take it
His reprimands have
always helped us, haven't they
Your medicine
I spoke to Babita
She said the training
was going well
And?
Geeta is not ok
Please talk to her
Hello
Geeta?
Ok, wait
Geeta...
Sorry, Papa.
Only 6 months remain for
the 19th Commonwealth Games
the biggest sporting event in India
What remains to be seen is how
the Indian players hold up
against the world's best
This time in the games,
I want three medals
Now whether they come
from you three
you three, or you three!
I don't care
There are 6 months left
Got that?
Geeta, come here
You will get one medal
Not in the category
that you are losing in
but in the category
in which you can win
Got me?
It's difficult for you to survive
in the 55 kilo category
You too must have
realised that by now
In the 51 kilo category,
you can hold your own and maybe win
Monitor everyone's diet strictly
No mess ups
-Sir!
Sir, I want to fight in the
55 kilo category!
If you fight in the 55 kilo category
you'll get no where!
She has to lost four kilos
Change her diet
From tomorrow we'll start your training
in the 51 kilo category
Come on girls
Why won't you win
in the 55 kilo category
No need for you
to lose weight
You will fight in the
55 kilo category and win!
I'm coming to Patiala
We don't know anyone in Patiala
How will you stay for 6 months?
On rent
And food?
I'll cook
I'll cook uncle!
I was thinking thay
I too could come along
What will you do there?
Well, in the past they did well
when they trained with me
So if they train with me
in the future too...
Honestly I think I am
their good luck charm
I mean... that's what I think
And, I will buy veg for you,
chop them for you
run errands for you,
press your feet
I'll make sure you are stress-free
You see..
it's the Commonwealth Games
We can't take any chances
Start preparing for gold!
'Patiala'
The room is on top
Come
Is there no other room
in the same budget?
It's nice
yes
It's nice, indeed
I have to admit!
Yes?
Geeta and Babita Kumari's
father and close cousin
How cow!
Uncle, doesn't this place
seem lovely?
How are you, champ?
And you?
Why are you here?
Uncle insisted that I come
He said it's the Commonwealth Game,
We can't take a chance
Shut up 'TTSS'
Geeta's 51 kilo category
training has started
You continue their diet and training
I'll supplement the rest
What time does
your training start
7am
Ok
Be ready at 5am tomorrow
Stop... stop
Straight attacks won't do
You have to play with
the opponents mind
Fake a move
but make another
Sir, I had put her on a diet
but, I don't know why
it hasn't reduced
What have you been up to, Geeta
Will you say something
or just keep crying?
Sir, judging by their actions
I feel they don't need NSA
The rest is up to you
Do you all have something to say?
So you admit you are at fault
Sir, they have just one fault
That their father is crazy
He is so crazy about getting
a gold for the country
that in their childhood itself
he snatched away their toys
and made them wrestle
When they resisted
he cut their hair off
In order to prepare them
he made them wrestle boys
Took the taunts and abuses
of the entire village
just so that one day they would
make the country proud
Look sir
Look
50 rupees won at Rohtak
This in Hisar
This in Chandigarh
This... this all this.. sir
These girls have traveled
a long way to reach here, sir
Now don't tell them to turn back
It's all my fault
I humbly apologise
Coach-sir is just concerned
with getting three medals
No matter if they are bronze
But I want our country
to win gold
And this girl can do it, sir
All of you, please wait outside
You've made a mistake
by wasting time
In 55 kilos Geeta won't even
get selected for India
If she had fought in the 51 kilos
she could've won a medal
She should've won a medal
much earlier in 55 kilos
You are responsible for that!
What did I do wrong?
Geeta's natural game is attacking
By putting technique above instinct,
you've changed her game
It's like telling a tigar
to fight like an elephant
You'll be left with neither
a tiger nor an elephant
So, why don't you tell me
With your permission, I would like to
demonstrate it here and now
They're calling you inside
What happened was wrong
But the commitee has decided
to give them another chance
Thank you, sir
But, from today
Neither are you allowed
to enter the NSA premises
nor are they allowed
to step out
OK, sir
Today, make one for me too uncle
Sorry
Thank you
We had come to play the lead role
NSA made ours
a guest appearance
Let's head back now
No Omkar
They can stop me
from going inside
but no one can stop me
from coaching Geeta
Cheers, uncle
Against three of them
I held my own
But the one who
took me to the cleaners...
she was smaller than me
and not tha strong either
Do you have a recording
of this match?
Yes papa, in the library
Courier me a copy of them
Only three months remain
for the Delhi Commonwealth Games
And the fervor can be sensed at the
NSA in Patiala
Where are we going, uncle?
The one thing
I disliked about uncle
was his constant air of suspense
It could kill you
If you want to watch a movie
let's go to Amar Mahal
They don't show decent films here
Get off
Yes
How much for all the tickets
of the next show?
Which film do you
want to watch
We've brought it with us
Pause
Play
Are you done?
Your next show is sold-out too
What are you guys up to?
I mean, where is the movie from?
Atlanta... Indonesia.
Imported?
- Yes
Listen, can I make a copy?
Give me 50 rupees less
How will she win
if she fights like this?
Uncle!
Uncle, you've gathered
the knowledge
NSA has issued a shoot at sight
order against you
Sit
Again... suspense
Is this how you fight?
Like a quivering kitten?
If this is how you want to fight,
then don't
What happened, papa?
I saw all your matches
You weren't wrestling,
that's for sure!
Do you have copies of
the DVDs that you gave me
Yes, papa
Can you arrange to watch
then alone?
I'll borrow a laptop
Alright
Be ready 5am tomorrow
It's been a while since
papa gave me an earful
Felt good
Play the Fakarta fight, round one
I have, papa
Go to three minutes 58 seconds
You have a lead
of two points
Play, look
Threw away the lead, didn't you?
When the opponent is trailing
go for the juglar!
How did you do that?
Alternately, when you should be defending,
you are attacking and giving away points
You will gain nothing by
desperately chasing after points
You'll have to apply your mind
You've lost matches
that were yours to win!
Go ... Geeta!
National Trials
Each round consists of 2 minutes
However, there are 120 seconds
in those 2 minutes
Wait for that one second
when the opponent makes a mistake
She's good. Isn't she
Yes, sir
Very good!
Now you look ready, sis
Did you tell papa?
What did he say?
There's no need to get too happy!
Commonwealth Games 2010
Host nation India displaying
her ancient culture.
A proud moment indeed
And here comes
the Indian contingent
A huge welcome for them
Let us remind you that
the finest athletes
from 72 countries are participating
We'll be back tomorrow
to start off the events
Geeta was quite nervous
before her first bout
And that was expected
So far her performance
in international events had been poor
However little... the nation
still had hope on her
And this was probably
Geeta's last opportunity
This first match in women's wrestling,
55 kilo category is between
Geeta Kumari and
Melissa Anderson from Wales
Go. Geeta.
Geeta seems quite nervous
Now let's see if she can
break her jinx.
of losing in the first couple
of rounds
We would like to remind
our spectators
That there will be three rounds
of 2 minutes each
Whoever wins two rounds,
wins the match.
Match begins
Both are quite alert.
1 point to Melissa
Melissa : 1 - Geeta : 0
Melissa seems stronger
3 points to Melissa.
What are you doing, Geeta?
Melissa : 4 - Geeta : 0
If Geeta gives away
2 more points
Melissa will win this round
on tech superiority
And Melissa gets 2 points
Exactly as we feared!
Melissa has won the first round
Technical Superiority 6 - 0.
What are you doing, Geeta
Don't lost so badly!
We now need to see that
after losing the first round badly
is Geeta capable of making
a comeback in round 2
2 points to Melissa.
1 more point to Melissa.
The match seems to be
slipping our of Geeta's hands
You are not to lose, Geeta!
Come on, Geeta!
Geeta lagging by 3 points.
She'll have to score real quick.
2 points to Geeta.
Melissa : 3 - Geeta : 2
Geeta tries to score some more
But the referee blows the whistle
The round is nearing completion
Geeta is still behind by a point
Go, Geeta!
Geeta in trouble
Geeta gets 3 points.
Geeta : 5 - Melissa 3
Just 4 seconds to go.
Yes, Geeta!
Geeta is back in the match!
It's one round each
Geeta has shown that she is not
going to accept defeat so easily
It's the last round
Play defensive
Got it?
Play attack
And the last round begins
Geeta on the attack.
1 point for Geeta.
Geeta : 1 - Melissa : 0
2 more points for Geeta.
Geeta : 3 - Melissa : 0
Will she manage to keep her lead?
Very good. Defend now
3 points for Melissa.
I told you to defend
No problem,
Keep attacking
The score is 3 - 3
Go for it, Geeta!
This match can tilt either way
Geeta was poised to win
but lost her lead
Geeta in danger
Wow! What a move!
3 points to Geeta!
Keep her down. Geeta
Geeta has won this match!
India's Geeta Kumari Phogat,
has proven her critics wrong
A proud moment for Geeta's father,
Mahavir Singh Phogat
So far India has won
5 gold, 13 silver
and seven bronze medals
In women's wrestling
India's Geeta Phogat
has entered the semi-finals
of the 55 kilo category
Geeta will now face
Naomi Edwards
2 time world champion
What do you think?
Naomi is a very strong wrestler
Extremely aggressive and attacking
She doesn't give any
opportunity to her opponent
It's not going to be easy
for Geeta this time
Today, you played as per your will
Now, do as I say
Or it's impossible to win
It's a difficult one,
but not impossible
You'll have to play offensive!
You have to play defensive
Just go for the points!
Don't go for the points
You'll get a lot of opportunities
Don't give her any opportunities
because she won't give you any
Force a lock-jam each time
If she doesn't get to score
she'll get frustrated
and will give you an opportunity
That's the moment
we should grab!
Semi finals kelas 55-kg.
Geeta Kumari vs
Nigeria's Naomi Edwards
Naomi attacking from the start
And against her nature
Geeta playing defensive
Naomi attacks
Geeta in trouble
Geeta putting up a strong defense.
Geeta holding her back
Naomi made a strong attempt
But Geeta held her own
Go on the attack
Go easy
Naomi gets rough
She seems frustrated
Naomi twisting Geeta's wrist
Naomi is being given a warning.
Hand in there, Geeta!
3 points to Naomi.
Geeta had been
holding her off well
A really good effort
But Naomi broken
through her defense
Geeta has to act fast
Geeta gets Naomi down
1 point to Geeta.
She's still trying
And time's up!
Geeta played well
but she's lost this first round
What are you doing, Geeta?
Why don't you attack?
The second round begins
Naomi tries to flip Geeta.
But Geeta defends well
Naomi puts all her strength
but Geeta isn't giving her a chance
This is an exciting match
Naomi trying hard
but Geeta isn't giving her space
Naomi attacks again
Geeta defends.
A nice defense by Geeta.
The referee breaks the fight
Second round is still 0 - 0
Naomi must be wondering
how to break Geeta's defense.
if she doesn't get to score,
she'll get frustrated
and will give you an opportunity
Naomi attacks.
That's the moment
we should grab!
3 points.
And Geeta wins this round 3- 0
Naomi, look at me
That girl she's smart
But you are twice as smart
Ok
Don't allow her to turn you easily
How are you fighting?
Sir, I am fighting as I have learnt
The third and final round has started
It's interesting to see
that Naomi is now
playing cautiously
Naomi trying real hard
But Geeta is holding her back
It's a lock position again
Naomi attacks again
Geeta holds her back
Will Naomi score?
Hold on, Geeta!
The score stands at 0 - 0
Naomi tries harder
Geeta is exposed here
but holds her back
Geeta handing on
by the skin of her teeth
Only 12 seconds left
The score still 0- 0
Geeta attacks.
With that this round is tied at 0 - 0.
She could have scored
Now there'll be a toss
Now there will be a toss
This is known as a 'clinch'
The wrestler who wins the toss
gets to choose a grip
and gets 30 seconds to score
In 99 percent of the cases
the one who wins the toss.
wins the match
Maybe even destiny
doesn't want Geeta to win
It's next to impossible to defend
against Naomi for 30 seconds
Which leg do you choose?
-Right
Naomi has chosen
Geeta's right leg
Geeta takes a defensive position
Naomi takes her grip of choice
Now Geeta has two options
Now allow Naomi to score
for 30 seconds
or score herself,
and win the match
In this position against Naomi
both are almost impossible
She lifts Geeta.
And Geeta scores a points
No one expected
Geeta to win this match
She has beaten the number one
contender for gold
In the very exciting clinch
and entered the finals!
And let'shope
that Geeta Phogat...
maintains her wonderful form
in the finals too
Shall we go, uncle?
Let's see the next match
Let's find out whether Geeta's finals
is against the Australian
I'm very proud of Geeta
She followed my strategy to the The result is in front of you
Here she comes
She looks good
I mean.... as a wrestler
Uncle, isn't she the
same one from the DVD?
Angelina Watson.
She's defeated Geeta twice
She's played well till now
And she'll play well
in the finals too
I've always had faith in Geeta
Sooner or later she had to
win an international medal
A silver i guarenteed now!
The final won't be so easy
Geeta!
Your game has changed dramatically
how did this happen?
The entire credit for this
goes to my father
He never stopped believing in me
Hello Mr Shamim.
Congratulations
Geeta fought very well
All of Balali is proud
And these girls insisted
on watching Geeta's match
in the stadium
or they won't eat
How did you like the match?
Loved it"
Give this to her
What is this?
I prayed for her
Tomorrow is the final
Bless you
How can we allow this sir?
Mahavir Singh is shouting instructions
to Geeta from the audience
The poor thing is getting confused
whether to listen to him or me
From her game, it sure doesn't
seem like she's confused
Besides, how can we ask
the audience to remain silent?
Aren't you the coach?
She should be listening to you
No.. sir.. she is listening to me
That's why she's winning.
- Then what's the problem?
You wanted a bronze right?
It's quite possible that
tomorrow she may win gold
No?
I'm surprised she's made it so far
but I am happy for her
It should be an interesting
final tomorrow
Playing an Indian
in front of an Indian crowd
Beating her, of course!
Angelina, any pressure
before the finals?
Yeah, I'm sure she must be
under tremendous pressure
I've beaten her twice
First round?
- Yeah
Yeah, first round
So thank you and
...Namaste!
What's the strategy
for tomorrow papa?
There is only one strategy
for tomorrow, child
You have to fight in a way
that people remember you
If you win silver
Sooner or later
you'll be forgotten
If you win gold,
you will become an example
And examples are given, child...
not forgotten
See those girls?
If you win tomorrow
you will not win alone
Millions of girls like them
will win along with you
It'll be a victory for every girl who
is considered inferior to boys
Who is forced
into household chores
who is maried off
to raise children
Tomorrow's match is
the most important one
Because tomorrow you won't be
fighting just that Australian
but all those people
who think less of girls
The finals of the women's wrestling
Commonwealth Games 2010.
55-kg category is about to begin
Geeta Kumari verses Angelina Watson.
We'd like to remind you all
that never before has
an Indian female wrestler
ever won gold in the
Commonwealth Games.
In this crowd, we see.
a lot of hope, enthusiasm
and the Indian flag
Halo, sir"
Aren't you Mahavir Singh?
Geeta's father?
- Yes
A moment please
The chairman of the Wrestling
Federation wants to meet you
Some important matter
I'll meet him later
It's my daughters match
He's a big man
He might get offended
Just 2 minutes
You carry on, I'll be there
The entire credit for this
goes to my father"
Go... take the credit
How much further is it?
We are almost there, sir
Where have you got me?
Hey, brother!
What are you doing, brother?
A thunderous applause for Geeta
as she walks in
Is anyone there?
Hello!
Anyone there?
This is the final
Play carefully
Angelina Watson enters the arena.
And the final match begins!
Go for gold, Geeta!
Angelina aggressive
from the start
She attacks
Geeta defends.
And 3 points for Geeta.
Geeta takes a big lead
right from the start
Geeta : 3 - Angelina : 0
Good... good!
Another point for Geeta.
Geeta : 4 - Angelina : 0
Geeta playing very well

1 point to Angelina.
Angelina looks for a takedown
Geeta defends well
Referee whistles
Geeta leads 4-1.
1 point to Geeta,
Geeta : 5 - Angelina : 1.
And with this Geeta Kumari
wins the first round quite easily
Perhaps Angelina is realizing
that this is not the same Geeta
whom she had defeated
easily in the past.
And the second round starts
Will Geeta win this round
and create history
An excellent takedown!
1 point to Geeta.
Geeta : 1 - Angelina : 0
Go ... Geeta. Go!

No problem...Geeta!
Angelina seems furious.
1 point for Angelina.
Angelina : 1 - Geeta : 4.
Geeta is still in danger
2 points for Angelina.
Geeta : 4 - Angelina : 3.
No problem... come on!
Geeta still leads by 1 point.
She needs to hold on on toit
a little longer
