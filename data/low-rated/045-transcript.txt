 We see the gate activating and guards surrounding it with their 
               weapons drawn. This iris is closed.

                         Open the iris, have Teal'C come to the 
                         gate room.
 
               
               GATE ROOM

               
               Jack walks in and we see a lone cloaked figure exit the wormhole. 
               The guards aim their weapons at the figure. The figure removes 
               the cloak and reveals herself as a beautiful woman. She spreads 
               her arms in a gesture of peace.

                         I mean you no harm.

               
               The gate disengages.

               
                                     JACK
                         Bra'Tak! .you've ... done something 
                         with your hair!

                                     SHO'NAC
                         I am Sho'Nak of the Red Hills. Master 
                         Bra'Tak opened the Chappa'ai but was 
                         unable to accompany me.
 
               
                                     JACK
                         Why is that?

               
                                     SHO'NAC
                         There is much unrest on Chulak. He took 
                         great risk in sending me here. (Teal'C 
                         enters the gate room. )Teal'C!
 
               
                                     TEAL'C (SURPRISED)
                         Sho'Nak!

                                     TEAL'C
                         Indeed.

               
               Jack signals for the guards to lower their weapons. Sho'Nak walks 
               down the ramp to Teal'C and they stand staring at each other 
               holding hands.

                         attention) Teal'C . how about a little 
                         introduction of some sort.
 
               
                                     SHO'NAC
                         There is no need. (to Jack) BRA'TAC 
                         has told me much of the Tau'ri. You 
                         are O'NEILL.TEAL'C'S apprentice.
 
               
                                     O'NEILL
                         Yes.(realizes what she said) apprentice?
 
                         
               
               TEAL'C smiles .

               
                                     SHO'NAC
                         Also a warrior of great skill and cunning.
 
                         
               
                                     O'NEILL

               HAMMOND enters.

                         HAMMOND of Texas, a great and strong 
                         leader among humans.
 
               
                                     HAMMOND
                         What can we do for you?

               
                                     SHO'NAC
                         You must take me to the Tok'ra immediately. 
                         (O'NEILL raises his eyebrow) I have 
                         information that could destroy the Goa'uld. 
                         (Everyone looks at her)
 
               
               BRIEFING ROOM

               
               SG1, HAMMOND, JANET and SHO'NAC are sat around the table.

               
                                     SHO'NAC
                         I have found a way to communicate with 
                         my symbiote.
 
               
               JACK (to TEAL'C) Is that possible?

               
                                     TEAL'C
                         It is not.

               
                                     SHO'NAC
                         That is what we were trained to believe 
                         TEAL'C. The Goa'uld have no wish for 
                         the Jaffa to influence their young.
 
                         
               
                                     DANIEL
                         That makes sense.

               
                                     TEAL'C
                         How then was this communion achieved?
 
                         
               
                                     SHO'NAC 
                         Within a deep state of Kel'no'reen.
 
                         
               
                                     SAM
                         Well we know that the symbiote is completely 
                         isolated from the Jaffa who carries 
                         it. How can there be communication?
 
                         
               
                                     JANET
                         Medically speaking the symbiote acts 
                         almost like an internal organ. There's 
                         an exchange of hormones and electrical 
                         impulses but it's on a completely unconscious 
                         level.
 
               
                                     HAMMOND
                         It's a function of their immune system.
 
                         
               
                                     SHO'NAC
                         It has taken many years but I have raised 
                         that primal communication to the conscious 
                         level.
 
               
                                     DANIEL
                         Oh ok, assuming that you err.what do 
                         you talk about?
 
               
                                     SHO'NAC
                         I have convinced it that the Goa'uld 
                         are evil. That its own desires for power 
                         and domination are wrong. It is willing 
                         to join the Tok'ra and reveal all Goa'uld 
                         secrets to them. (She looks at HAMMOND 
                         )
 
               
                                     O'NEILL
                         I know I'm just the apprentice at this 
                         table but.
 
               
                                     TEAL'C
                         Why then not instruct this symbiote 
                         to deliver these secrets directly?
 
                         
               
                                     O'NEILL
                         Exactly.

               
                                     SHO'NAC
                         We do not communicate in words. It is 
                         more feelings, images, memories. It 
                         will only be fully capable of communicating 
                         the knowledge it was born with once 
                         it takes a host.
 
               
                                     CARTER
                         And since you convinced it that the 
                         Goa'uld are evil it ill only take a 
                         willing host?
 
               
                                     SHO'NAC 
                         (in pain) It is most urgent!

               
                                     TEAL'C
                         Your symbiote is ready to take a host 
                         even now!
 
               
                                     SHO'NAC
                         It has already passed its time. You 
                         have my word that it will harm no one. 
                         I have convinced it to wait!
 
               
               JACK raises his eyebrows in disbelief.

               
                                     JANET
                         Once a Goa'uld larvae leaves the body 
                         the Jaffa's immune system stops functioning. 
                         You're putting yourself at great risk.
 
                         
               
                                     SHO'NAC
                         I believe that risk is worth taking. 
                         If you would take me to the Tok'ra immediately?
 
                         
               
                                     HAMMOND
                         We can't do that I'm sorry.

               
                                     SHO'NAC
                         (Seeing everyone's disbelieving faces) 
                         You do not believe I speak the truth.
 
                         
               
                                     DANIEL
                         No, it's not that we don't believe you.
 
                         
               
               
                                     O'NEILL 
                         I think what TEAL'C is trying to say 
                         is that.
 
               
                                     TEAL'C
                         I have said precisely what I intended 
                         O'NEILL! (They stare at each other. 
                         )
 
               
                                     JACK
                         Ok then I guess what I'm trying to say 
                         is that we'd like to believe you, we 
                         really would.
 
               
                                     SHO'NAC
                         You have my word.(looks around) but 
                         that is not enough! (She stands to leave) 
                         Then the secrets of the Goa'uld will 
                         die with me!
 
               
                                     HAMMOND
                         SHO'NAC please understand?

               
               SHO'NAC (in pain as the snake stirs) I do understand General 
               HAMMOND, BRA' TAC was wrong about the wisdom of the Tau'ri! (She 
               collapses to the floor in agony. Everyone stands alarmed. )
 
               
               
                                     TEAL'C
                         SHO'NAC! SHO'NAC! (The symbiote suddenly 
                         half emerges from her pouch. Everyone 
                         is shocked. JACK looks disgusted at 
                         the symbiote. )
 
               
               HAMMOND (to guard) Airman! (The guard aims his gun at the symbiote. 
               )
 
               
                                     TEAL'C (HANDS UP)
                         Do not! (SHO'NAC whispers in Goa'uld 
                         to the symbiote and it recedes into 
                         her pouch. SHO'NAC passes out. )
 
               
                                     TEAL'C
                         Dr FRASIER you may now approach.

               
                                     JANET
                         ( runs over to help SHO'NAC. ) We need 
                         to get her to the infirmary.
 
               
               INFIRMARY

               
               JANET is monitoring SHO'NAC who is asleep in an infirmary bed. 
               TEAL'C is sat on the bed watching her. JACK and HAMMOND are also 
               present. JANET walks over to HAMMOND and JACK.
 
               
                                     JANET
                         She wasn't exaggerating. The symbiote 
                         is fully adult.
 
               
                                     JACK
                         Yeah, saw that!

               
                                     HAMMOND
                         So her immune system is breaking down?
 
                         
               
                                     JANET
                         Yes, I'm not sure how long the symbiote 
                         will remain before it has no choice 
                         but to seek out a new host. That is 
                         its primal instinctual behavior. I may 
                         have to recommend quarantine sir.
 
                         
               
               HAMMOND (to JACK) Well if you think so?

               
                                     JACK
                         (Shocked) Absolutely.sir!

               
                                     SHO'NAC
                         (Quietly) No.

               
                                     JANET
                         (Walks over to bed) I gave you a sedative. 
                         You should be asleep.
 
               
                                     SHO'NAC
                         Col-mah has neutralized the sedative.
 
                         
               
                                     JANET
                         Col-mah?

               
                                     TEAL'C (ANGRILY) 
                         It mean's child. (To SHO'NAC) The demon 
                         you carry within you in no child!
 
                         
               
                                     SHO'NAC
                         Do I not carry it in me as I would my 
                         own? Have I not taught it right from 
                         wrong as any mother would? You have 
                         closed your mind TEAL'C. I expected 
                         more!
 
               
               HAMMOND and JACK exchange glances at this outburst.

               
                                     TEAL'C
                         May we speak privately?

               
                                     SHO'NAC
                         My symbiote has assured me that this 
                         will not happen again.
 
               
                                     JACK
                         (sarcastically) Oh well if the snake 
                         says so then who are we!
 
               
               The HUMANS leave.

               
                                     SHO'NAC (PAINED)
                         The others I can understand, but you 
                         have known me since before I went to 
                         the temple! How can you doubt me? This 
                         is my life's work!
 
               
                                     TEAL'C
                         A life lived in worship of the Goa'uld!
 
                         
               
                                     SHO'NAC
                         No, I believe now as you do that they 
                         are false gods.
 
               
                                     TEAL'C
                         Words from one who became a priestess 
                         in the temple.
 
               
               
                                     TEAL'C
                         BRA'TAC is wise, but I do not know why 
                         he would have sent you here like this!
 
                         
               
                                     SHO'NAC
                         He believes TEAL'C. How can I make you 
                         believe too?
 
               
                                     TEAL'C
                         There is a way.

               
               DANIEL'S OFFICE.

               
               DANIEL and SAM are reviewing information on the Goa'uld as JACK 
               knocks and walks in.
 
               
                                     CARTER
                         How is she?

               
                                     JACK
                         Err.FRASIER says she has maybe a couple 
                         of days tops. Find anything?
 
               
                                     DANIEL
                         No but TEAL'C knows more on the subject 
                         than I ever will.
 
               
                                     CARTER
                         He sure doesn't believe her.

               
               O'NEILL (leaning down on the desk) Well there may be a little 
               more than meets the eye here. I'm thinkin' they got history!
 
               
               
                                     CARTER
                         History?

               
                                     O'NEILL
                         Oh yeah!

               
                                     DANIEL
                         She's a temple priestess.

               
                                     O'NEILL
                         So?

               
                                     DANIEL
                         So they don't do a lot of dating.

               
                                     O'NEILL
                         Maybe not, but there was some serious 
                         sparkage when she arrived!
 
               
                                     CARTER
                         Ok, the question is what if she's telling 
                         the truth?
 
               
                                     O'NEILL
                         So what, she can't tell the Tok'ra anymore 
                         than they already know can she?
 
               
                                     CARTER
                         Actually sir she can, the Tok'ra.

               
               
                                     CARTER
                         Physiologically they're both parasitical 
                         and pass on their knowledge through 
                         genetic memory yes, but the majority 
                         of the Tok'ra left the Goa'uld gene 
                         pool over two thousand years ago.
 
                         
               
                                     DANIEL
                         Yeah, they probably learnt a thing or 
                         two in that time.
 
               
                                     SAM
                         Which makes SHO'NAC'S symbiote very 
                         valuable sir. To us and the Tok'ra.
 
                         
               
                                     JACK
                         If TEAL'C doesn't buy it then I don't 
                         buy is and there's no way of proving 
                         it, so what are you going to do?
 
               
               TEAL'C enters the room.

               
                                     TEAL'C
                         O'NEILL?

               
                                     JACK
                         (Turning around) Master TEAL'C.

               
                                     TEAL'C
                         I am in need of your assistance.

               
                                     O'NEILL
                         I'm here to serve!

               
                                     TEAL'C 
                         DANIELJACKSON, MajorCARTER I am in need 
                         of your assistance also.
 
               
               They look puzzled and follow him from the office.

               
               TEAL'C'S QUARTERS IN THE SGC

               
               The room is full of lit candles. TEAL' C is sat ready to meditate 
               and the rest of SG1 watch over him.
 
               
                                     TEAL'C
                         In the deepest levels of Kelnoor-reem 
                         the heart beats in extremely long intervals. 
                         It is even possible to meditate so deeply 
                         that one may stop the heart altogether. 
                         The practice is forbidden.
 
               
                                     SAM
                         Wouldn't your symbiote try to start 
                         it up again?
 
               
                                     TEAL'C
                         That is correct. According to SHO'NAC 
                         it is only at this time that a communion 
                         between Jaffa and symbiote is possible.
 
                         
               
                                     CARTER
                         Like a near death experience?

               
                                     TEAL'C
                         That is correct.

               
                                     O'NEILL
                         Is it dangerous?

               
                                     DANIEL
                         JACK, he's stopping his heart.

               
                                     JACK
                         (Annoyed look at DANNY) I mean for us!
 
                         
               
                                     TEAL'C
                         I am unsure of what will occur if and 
                         when communion with my symbiote is achieved. 
                         It may be necessary to restrain me.
 
                         
               
                                     O'NEILL
                         Well.knock yourself out!

               
               TEAL'C meditates as SG1 watch anxiously.

               
               Suddenly he sees a vision of a Jaffa being dragged by other Jaffa 
               and a woman.
 
               
               
                                     DANIEL
                         It's working?

               
                                     TEAL'C
                         I will begin again.

               
               He meditates and sees his father and the woman. CRONOS appears 
               and TEAL'C's father is brought before him. He crushes TEAL'C'S 
               father's symbiote by thrusting his hands into his pouch and kills 
               his father. As his father dies in the vision TEAL'C collapses 
               in his quarters.
 
               
               SAM rushes to the phone in the room as DANIEL and JACK move to 
               help him.
 
               
                                     SAM
                         Medical emergency, TEAL'C'S quarters!
 
                         
               
               
               CARTER (on telephone) Delay that last order and stand by.

               
                                     JACK (TO DANIEL)
                         Get him up. (They help TEAL'C to sit 
                         up. ) What happened?
 
               
                                     TEAL'C
                         I have received a vision from my symbiote. 
                         It was a memory it chose to share. Its 
                         hatred for me is great.
 
               
                                     CARTER
                         Then it is possible. SHO'NAC is telling 
                         the truth.
 
               
                                     TEAL'C
                         Yes.yes!

               
               BRIEFING ROOM

               
               We see ANISE waiting to meet with SG1 and HAMMOND. She walks 
               to the briefing table and sits down.
 
               
                                     ANISE
                         The great queen Ageria. She broke from 
                         the Goa'uld over 2000 years ago. Her 
                         offspring became the Tok'ra.
 
               
               DANIEL Ageria, Roman goddess of fountains.

               
                                     O'NEILL
                         Fountains?

               
                                     DANIEL
                         Also childbirth.

               
                                     O'NEILL
                         How do those two go together?

               
                                     DANIEL
                         It doesn't matter, she was also adviser 
                         to Numo Pontillius, a legendary ruler.
 
                         
               
                                     ANISE
                         Correct Dr JACKSON. Ageria came to the 
                         Tau'ri to stop the Goa'uld from taking 
                         humans through the Stargate as slaves. 
                         Ra found her and killed her but not 
                         before she had spawned our movement.
 
                         
               
                                     CARTER
                         Literally?

               
                                     ANISE
                         Yes.

               
                                     O'NEILL
                         Thanks for the image.

               
                                     HAMMOND
                         Then the original number of Tok'ra is 
                         all you have?
 
               
                                     ANISE
                         Very few Goa'uld came over to our side, 
                         but none in the past few hundred years. 
                         Our numbers have diminished as symbiotes 
                         unable to find new hosts died or fell 
                         in battle. That is why SHO'NAC'S offer 
                         is so provocative. Until the symbiote 
                         is blended with a host we cannot be 
                         sure of the outcome. But if what she 
                         claims is correct we could one day increase 
                         our numbers.
 
               
                                     HAMMOND
                         So you've decided to accept her offer?
 
                         
               
                                     ANISE
                         I will make the proposal to the council 
                         with my recommendation.
 
               
                                     O'NEILL
                         How long will that take?

               
                                     ANISE
                         It will not be an easy decision. There 
                         are great risks involved.
 
               
                                     CARTER
                         She doesn't have a lot of time.

               
                                     TEAL'C
                         SHO'NAC'S symbiote is fully mature. 
                         It must take a host within the day, 
                         two at most.
 
               
                                     ANISE
                         Then I will leave immediately. (She 
                         gets up, as do the others to leave. 
                         )
 
               
               TEAL'C (To ANISE) I would make a personal request.

               
               FREYA (Host mode) What is it TEAL'C?

               
                                     TEAL'C
                         SHO'NAC came to this world expecting 
                         not to survive.
 
               
                                     FREYA
                         She needs a symbiote to replace that 
                         which she now carries.
 
               
                                     TEAL'C
                         By the time you return it may be too 
                         late.
 
               
                                     FREYA
                         There are no Jaffa within the Tok'ra 
                         ranks.
 
               
                                     TEAL'C (EMOTIONALLY)
                         I do not wish for her to die.

               
                                     FREYA
                         I cannot promise TEAL'C but we will 
                         try.
 
               
               TEAL'C bows and ANISE leaves.

               
               SHO'NAK'S QUARTERS

               
               TEAL'C enters the room. There are many candles lit and SHO'NAC 
               is sat meditating on the floor.
 
               
                                     TEAL'C (SMILING)
                         The Tok'ra council is considering your 
                         offer.
 
               
                                     SHO'NAC
                         My symbiote is eager to meet them. I 
                         hope they can reach their decision within 
                         the time.
 
               
               She clutches her stomach in pain. TEAL'C reaches down and helps 
               her to her feet.
 
               
                                     TEAL'C
                         Your pain grows worse!

               
                                     SHO'NAC
                         Yes.

               
                                     TEAL'C
                         For what reason did you wait so long?
 
                         
               
                                     SHO'NAC
                         I was afraid you would not believe. 
                         Since word came to the temple that you 
                         betrayed APOPHIS I have thought of you 
                         every day.
 
               
                                     TEAL'C
                         As a Shol'va?

               
                                     SHO'NAC
                         No TEAL'C. Because of you my doubts 
                         became certainties. When we were children 
                         you were always the strongest, the bravest. 
                         That you would one day be first prime 
                         was never doubted. But you did what 
                         no Jaffa before you had ever done. You 
                         challenged the gods themselves and won. 
                         (she strokes his face) Among many on 
                         Chulak you are as revered as the gods 
                         once were and yet you walk away.
 
               
                                     TEAL'C
                         My place is here.

               
                                     SHO'NAC
                         Is it? BRA'TAC cannot be expected to 
                         bear the burden alone. It was you who 
                         first began walking this path. Do not 
                         abandon those who have followed you 
                         this far!
 
               
               She turns away from him. He grabs her and spins her around.
 
               
               
                                     TEAL'C (ANGRILY)
                         I have abandoned no one.

               
               He releases her and she walks away again then turns to him.
 
               
               
                                     SHO'NAC
                         When I die and you are the only one 
                         capable of teaching others what I have 
                         learned, what will you do then?
 
               
                                     TEAL'C
                         Do not concern yourself with me.

               
                                     SHO'NAC
                         I have all but given my life for a cause 
                         that you inspired!
 
               
                                     TEAL'C
                         Tell skak, Kree! (She looks at him shocked) 
                         I will advise you when there is news. 
                         (He turns to leave the room. )
 
               
                                     SHO'NAC
                         When you touched the mind of your symbiote. 
                         What did it show you?
 
               
                                     TEAL'C (STOPPING)
                         The murder of my father. It was a most 
                         painful death.
 
               
                                     SHO'NAC
                         At the hands of CRONOS?

               
                                     TEAL'C
                         Yes.

               
                                     SHO'NAC
                         It wanted you to know fear.

               
                                     TEAL'C
                         Yes.

               
                                     SHO'NAC
                         You are stronger than that. Why does 
                         it appear to have succeeded? (She walks 
                         up to him. He is facing away from her. 
                         ) My first communion was the same. It 
                         took many days before I tried again. 
                         But one day the images it chose to share 
                         with me began to change. They became 
                         sorrowful, as though my Ko-mah were 
                         awakening to it's own shape. In time 
                         the images became beautiful, even caring. 
                         If that is all.
 
               
               
                                     SHO'NAC
                         No, never more. (They kiss, and make 
                         up AQ!-Style!)
 
               
               TEAL'C is exiting SHO'NAC'S room as DANIEL is walking down the 
               corridor.
 
               
                                     DANIEL
                         TEAL'C!

               
                                     TEAL'C (SMILING)
                         Kell shah DANIELJACKSON! (SOMEBODY gots 
                         himself a piece of @$$!!! Temple priestess 
                         my eye! )
 
               
                                     DANIEL
                         Morning, how's err SHO'NAC?

               
                                     TEAL'C
                         The pain of carrying a symbiote past 
                         it's time is extreme. SHO'NAC bears 
                         it well.
 
               
                                     DANIEL
                         I can imagine. Listen, I'm just heading 
                         off for breakfast.
 
               
                                     TEAL'C
                         I am not.

               
               TEAL'C moves to go in a different direction to DANIEL.

               
                                     DANIEL
                         Err.could you stop walking? (TEAL'C 
                         stops and turns to face DANIEL. )
 
                         
               
               DANIEL (quietly) Is everything all right?

               
                                     TEAL'C
                         Yes. (AQ!'sa note: Of course he's allright! 
                         He just got a piece of ... )
 
               
                                     DANIEL
                         You see, I've just noticed that you've 
                         been, you know preoccupied lately, obviously 
                         and err I'm kinda going out on a limb 
                         here asking but it's just that if you 
                         want to talk that I was here to talk.
 
                         
               
                                     TEAL'C
                         DANIELJACKSON! (HE grabs DANIEL by the 
                         shoulder and DANIEL looks at him surprised. 
                         ) If all Jaffa can be taught to commune 
                         with their symbiotes then the days of 
                         the Goa'uld are truly numbered!
 
               
                                     DANIEL
                         And SHO'NAC can teach them?

               
                                     TEAL'C
                         If SHO'NAC survives I intend to be at 
                         her side. If she does not I will not 
                         allow her sacrifice to be in vain!
 
                         
               
               Before DANIEL can reply CARTER comes running up to them.

               
                                     CARTER
                         TEAL'C, we just got word from the Tok'ra. 
                         They've accepted SHO'NAC'S offer.
 
                         
               
                                     TEAL'C
                         When may we depart?

               
                                     CARTER
                         Now, Colonel O'NEILL'S waiting for us 
                         in the gear up room.
 
               
               They walk away. DANIEL looks worried as he follows.

               
               VORASH.

               
               SG1 and SHO'NAC are met by some Tok'ra representatives.

               
               TOK'RA TUNNELS

               
               SG1 and SHO'NAC enter via the ring system. ANISE and two other 
               Tok'ra are waiting.
 
               
                                     ANISE
                         (Snake mode) SHO'NAC of the Red Hills, 
                         welcome to Vorash.
 
               
                                     SHO'NAC
                         It is a great honor to meet the Tok'ra.
 
                         
               
                                     O'NEILL
                         They're all right if you like the type. 
                         (Looks at Anise, and smiles)
 
               
                                     ANISE
                         It is an equal pleasure to see you Colonel 
                         O'NEILL. (She walks over to SG1 and 
                         shakes SAM'S hand.) Your father asked 
                         that I shake your hand and give Colonel 
                         O'NEILL a big kiss from him.
 
               
               CARTER(After sharing a look with O'NEILL) Err, that might have 
               been the other way around.
 
               
                                     O'NEILL
                         Maybe, is FREYA in there?

               
               ANISE blinks and the host takes control.

               
               FREYA (Host mode) Of course Colonel.

               
                                     SHO'NAC
                         Then it is true; host and symbiote share 
                         the body equally.
 
               
                                     FREYA
                         And we are both pleased to tell you 
                         good news. As you requested TEAL' C, 
                         one of our operatives has retrieved 
                         a newly spawned symbiote to replace 
                         that which SHO'NAC offers.
 
               
                                     SHO'NAC (TO TEAL'C) 
                         You have done this for me?

               
                                     FREYA
                         Not only for you. If you truly have 
                         turned your symbiote to the Tok' ra 
                         cause then your life is more valuable 
                         than any of ours!
 
               
                                     SHO'NAC
                         ( closes her eyes and whispers to her 
                         symbiote). Kell-mah, it will not be 
                         long now.
 
               
                                     TEAL'C
                         She has carried her symbiote far past 
                         its time.
 
               
                                     FREYA
                         Then come, this way. (Everyone follows 
                         her) We were able to find a host both 
                         willing and eager.
 
               
               O'NEILL (quietly) Eager too huh?

               
               They all enter a chamber where several people are waiting. ANISE 
               indicates to a man.
 
               
                                     ANISE
                         (Still in snake mode)This is the volunteer 
                         host HEBRON of Parabal.
 
               
                                     O'NEILL (TO HEBRON)
                         JACK O'NEILL, Earth. Err.forgive my 
                         bluntness here but do you have any idea 
                         what you are getting into?
 
               
                                     ANISE
                         We have told him everything.

               
                                     O'NEILL
                         Yeah, well I've noticed the Tok'ra have 
                         a tendency to leave out minor details 
                         along the way sometimes. (To HEBRON) 
                         You do know this thing's going to be 
                         in your head right? You only get your 
                         body part time?
 
               
                                     HEBRON
                         My own people were enslaved by the Goa'uld 
                         a generation ago, I understand what 
                         benefit may come of this.
 
               
               
                                     TEAL'C
                         This is SHO'NAC.

               
               SHO'NAC and HEBRON look at each other.

               
                                     HEBRON
                         What can you tell me of the one with 
                         whom I will spend the rest of my days?
 
                         
               
                                     SHO'NAC
                         That he wishes to forswear his birthright 
                         and desires to stop the Goa'uld from 
                         causing any more harm.
 
               
                                     HEBRON
                         Then we will have that in common.

               
                                     SHO'NAC
                         You will share with him much, much more 
                         than I. (She cries out in pain and collapses 
                         to the floor supported by TEAL'C. ) 
                         I have waited too long!
 
               
                                     TEAL'C
                         It must be done now!

               
                                     ANISE
                         We are not yet ready for the transference.
 
                         
               
                                     SHO'NAC
                         It can wait no longer! (Sounds of the 
                         symbiote emerging are heard. CARTER, 
                         O'NEILL and DANIEL grimace at the sight. 
                         ) TEAL'C it cannot wait!
 
               
               
               The symbiote emerges and O'NEILL draws his gun. The symbiote 
               lunges for HEBRON'S neck and enters it. HEBRON grasps at his 
               neck and gasps. He falls backwards. SHO'NAC passes out as ANISE 
               goes to HEBRON. SG1 stand back with a look of disgust at the 
               process. HEBRON'S eyes open and glow.
 
               
                                     ANISE
                         Colonel O'NEILL, lower your weapon the 
                         transference is complete.
 
               
                                     O'NEILL
                         Transference?!?!?!? THAT'S what you 
                         call that!?!?
 
               
                                     TEAL'C (TO SHO'NAC)
                         SHO'NAC?

               
               ANISE helps HEBRON to stand. HE has a wound on his neck where 
               the symbiote entered.
 
               
                                     HEBRON
                         (In Snake mode) There was no more time, 
                         SHO'NAC'S life was in grave danger. 
                         I had to act. (to ANISE) Have you a 
                         prim'ta ready for implantation?
 
               
                                     ANISE
                         Yes.

               
                                     HEBRON
                         (Still in snake mode) Do it now, she 
                         is near death. (ANISE nods at a guard 
                         who leaves. ) I am TANITH, it is my 
                         honor to pledge my allegiance to the 
                         Tok'ra.
 
               
               TEAL'C looks down at an unconscious SHO'NAC

               
               TOK'RA UNDERGROUND MEETING ROOM

               
               We see CARTER and O'NEILL sat around a table waiting for news. 
               DANIEL is stood leaning against CARTER'S chair. Footsteps are 
               heard approaching and they all look up.
 
               
                                     DANIEL
                         How is she?

               
               ANISE (Snake mode) SHO'NAC is still very weak. The symbiote we 
               were able to retrieve was quite young.
 
               
                                     CARTER
                         But she's gonna be ok?

               
                                     ANISE
                         We believe so.

               
               TANITH enters behind ANISE. O'NEILL eyes him suspiciously.

               
                                     O'NEILL
                         Hello HEBRON.

               
               TANITH (Snake mode) He is here Colonel O'NEILL.

               
                                     DANIEL
                         Actually we'd like to hear that from 
                         him.
 
               
               TANITH Of course. (He lowers his head) (Host mode) It is true, 
               it is a strange feeling but I am very much here.
 
               
                                     O'NEILL
                         How do we know that?

               
                                     HEBRON
                         TANITH wants you to know that we will 
                         submit to any test you may wish to perform 
                         to assure you that I am speaking freely 
                         as host. Rest assured TANITH is pure 
                         of heart. SHO'NAC was indeed a great 
                         teacher.
 
               
               O'NEILL Good, then maybe TANITH wouldn't mind sharing some of 
               that fine Goa' uld knowledge. (Is that sarcasm I hear in Jack's 
               voice?!) (Hebron bows his head)
 
               
                                     TANITH (SMILING)
                         (Snake Mode) Of course.

               
                                     ANISE
                         (Snake Mode) When the time is appropriate.
 
                         
               
                                     O'NEILL
                         I think now is appropriate.

               
                                     ANISE
                         I disagree.

               
                                     O'NEILL
                         Oh, here we go, here we go!

               
                                     ANISE
                         TANITH has asked to join the Tok'ra 
                         not the SGC.
 
               
                                     O'NEILL (ANGRILY) 
                         (Sounding alot like MacGyver) Are 
                         you kidding me!
 
               
                                     ANISE
                         We will gladly share what knowledge 
                         we feel is useful to the furthering 
                         of our alliance with Earth.
 
               
                                     CARTER
                         Does my father go along with this?
 
                         
               
                                     ANISE
                         I am sure he will.

               
                                     O'NEILL
                         How do I hang up with ANISE and talk 
                         to FREYA?
 
               
                                     ANISE
                         Why?

               
                                     O'NEILL
                         I *like* FREYA!

               
                                     ANISE
                         She and are in complete agreement.
 
                         
               
                                     O'NEILL
                         How do I know that?

               
                                     ANISE
                         I have told you.

               
                                     O'NEILL
                         And I'm supposed to trust you.You know 
                         this whole talking to two people in 
                         one body thing really sucks! (He's genuinly 
                         FED UP with the Tok'Ra!)
 
               
               TEAL'C and SHO'NAC enter the chamber. TANITH looks at SHO'NAC.
 
               
               
                                     TANITH
                         SHO'NAC! (She looks at him and smiles. 
                         )It is good to finally see the face 
                         of she that taught me so much!
 
               
                                     SHO'NAC
                         Oh, to speak with you in words it is 
                         something I never dreamed of. (JACK 
                         looks at SAM, shaking his head, and 
                         rolling his eyes; she does the same 
                         to DANIEL.
 
               
                                     TANITH
                         There will be time for words. You must 
                         stay a while we have so much to talk 
                         about.
 
               
                                     SHO'NAC
                         I know.

               
               
                                     TEAL'C
                         Her new symbiote is extremely young 
                         for the task of healing her.
 
               
               
               TANITH smiles at SHO'NAC and then leaves the room.

               
               O'NEILL puts his hat on.

               
               O'NEILL (annoyed) I guess we'll just mosey on back to Earth. 
               Tell General HAMMOND how the Tok'ra boned us again.
 
               
               He leaves followed by CARTER and DANIEL.

               
                                     ANISE
                         Colonel! (She follows after him. As 
                         do TEAL'C and SHO'NAC. O'NEILL is leading 
                         SG1 out of the tunnels being followed 
                         by ANISE. ) Please take no offense.
 
                         
               
                                     O'NEILL
                         Hey, we're getting used to it.

               
               They reach the transportation rings site. O'NEILL, CARTER and 
               DANIEL stand ready to be transported.
 
               
                                     O'NEILL
                         TEAL'C, you can come back and visit 
                         SHO'NAC after we've debriefed. (to ANISE 
                         sarcastically) That is if it's all right 
                         with our good friends and allies.

                         Swell.(to SG1) let's go.

               
                                     TEAL'C 
                         (looks at SHO'NAC ) O'NEILL, I would 
                         like a moment.
 
               
                                     O'NEILL
                         We'll wait at the gate.

               
               CARTER, DANIEL and O'NEILL leave via the transportation rings.

                         I must inform the Tau'ri of my intention 
                         to leave their service.
 
               
                                     SHO'NAC
                         I will await your return.

               
                                     TEAL'C
                         We will return to Chulak and tell every 
                         Jaffa in every village of your return.

               TEAL'C leaves via the transportation rings.

               
               TANITH'S QUARTERS IN TOK'RA BASE.

               
               We see TANITH looking at himself in a mirror. He turns around 
               as SHO'NAC enters the room.
 
               
                                     SHO'NAC
                         Have I disturbed you?

                         (EVIL snake mode! MWAHAHAHA!) The hour 
                         is late you should be resting.
 
               
                                     SHO'NAC
                         I could not wait to speak with you.
 
                         
               
                                     TANITH
                         Yes. (He walks over to her) We must 
                         speak of your audacity.
 
               
               
                                     TANITH
                         How dare a priestess touch the mind 
                         of one who would be her god!
 
               
                                     SHO'NAC
                         You despise the Goa'uld!

               
               
               SHO'NAC (shocked) But I showed you the.

               
                                     TANITH 
                         (clamps his hand over her mouth and 
                         grabs her. ) You showed me the means 
                         to destroy the Tok'ra. (She struggles 
                         in his arms. ) Now accept your reward. 
                         (AQ! Again: He's so sexy, oh, My!)(TANITH'S 
                         eyes glow and he smiles. )
 
               
               INT- SGC BRIEFING ROOM

               
               CARTER, DANIEL and HAMMOND are sat round the table. O'NEILL is 
               standing near to his seat. TEAL'C is standing at the end of the 
               table.

                         take my leave of the SGC.
 
               
               SG1 and HAMMOND look shocked.

               
                                     HAMMOND
                         Are you certain?

               
                                     O'NEILL
                         He means leave of absence sir!

               
                                     TEAL'C
                         I have said what I mean O'NEILL. I intend 
                         to live the remainder of my life on 
                         Chulak.
 
               
                                     O'NEILL
                         What on Earth for?

               
                                     TEAL'C
                         Do you not recognize the greatness of 
                         SHO'NAC'S achievement?
 
               
                                     DANIEL
                         I think the point is that if the whole 
                         idea was to get the secrets of the Goa'uld 
                         into the hands of the Tok'ra.
 
               
                                     O'NEILL
                         And us by the way.

               
                                     DANIEL
                         .Then it's done, mission accomplished!
 
                         
               
                                     CARTER
                         Yeah TEAL'C, even if you could train 
                         a large enough number of Jaffa to communicate 
                         with their symbiotes the Tok'ra have 
                         a hard enough time finding hosts.
 
                         
               
                                     O'NEILL
                         But the point is you belong here!

               
                                     TEAL'C
                         I belong where I am needed most O'NEILL 
                         and that is on Chulak at SHO 'NAC'S 
                         side.
 
               
               The sounds of the gate activating are heard and sirens sound.
 
               
               
                                     DAVIS
                         Off world activation! (They all leave 
                         the briefing room. We see armed guards 
                         stand ready by the gate. The iris is 
                         closed. )(SG1 and HAMMOND enter. ) Incoming 
                         traveler sir, it's the Tok'ra.
 
               
                                     O'NEILL
                         Here to share squat with us no doubt.
 
                         
               
                                     HAMMOND
                         Open the iris.

               
               The iris opens and ANISE steps through. She looks at TEAL'C sadly 
               and then two further Tok'ra step through the gate carrying a 
               stretcher with a body on it. TEAL'C runs to the gateroom followed 
               by the rest of SG1.

                         sorrow that I return.

                                     FREYA
                         We found the body just outside her chamber. 
                         (DANIEL, O'NEILL and CARTER look shocked. 
                         ) The symbiote she carried was also 
                         dead. If we had found a more mature 
                         larvae.
 
               
                                     TEAL'C
                         She appeared well!

               
                                     FREYA
                         SHO'NAC'S death is simply the unfortunate 
                         result of waiting too long.
 
               
                                     TEAL'C
                         ( pulls the sheet down from over SHO'NAC'S 
                         face). (emotionally) SHO' NAC, tell 
                         mah veriunte shree. Tell mah.

               TEAL'C leans and kisses SHO'NAC.

               
                                     ANISE (TO O'NEILL)
                         I wanted TEAL'C to have the body for 
                         whatever spiritual ritual he may wish 
                         to perform.
 
               
               TEAL'C looks close to tears.

               
               TEAL'C'S QUARTERS

               
               We see TEAL'C meditating surrounded by lit candles. He sees another 
               vision from his symbiote of his father's murder by CRONOS. As 
               CRONOS crushes his fathers symbiote TEAL'C screams in pain. O'NEILL 
               is walking down the corridor by TEAL'C'S quarters. He hears the 
               scream and rushes to knock on TEAL'C'S door .
 
               
                                     O'NEILL
                         TEAL'C? (Inside his room TEAL'C suddenly 
                         opens his eyes. ) (knocking on the door) 
                         TEAL'C! (TEAL'C opens his door )What's 
                         up?
 
               
                                     TEAL'C
                         SHO'NAC was murdered!

               
               INT- TOKRA MEETING ROOM

               
               We see O'NEILL and TEAL'C enter accompanied by some Tok'ra guards. 
               ANISE and two other Tok'ra are sat round the table. They stand.
 
               
               
                                     ANISE (SNAKE MODE)
                         We have not yet obtained information 
                         of any value from TANITH. Your return 
                         is premature.
 
               
                                     O'NEILL
                         You folks should invest in some doors.
 
                         
               
                                     ANISE
                         We have no secrets from each other.
 
                         
               
                                     O'NEILL
                         I beg to differ with you!

               
                                     TEAL'C
                         I have reason to believe the Goa'uld 
                         SHO'NAC carried was not truly convinced 
                         to become a Tok'ra. I believe the Goa'uld 
                         used this opportunity to become a spy 
                         among you.
 
               
                                     ANISE
                         What evidence have you for this?

               
                                     TEAL'C
                         The murder of SHO'NAC! The system lord 
                         CRONOS murdered my father by crushing 
                         his symbiote in such a way it allowed 
                         the symbiotes blood to mix directly 
                         with that of my father. The method is 
                         slow and immensely painful.
 
               
                                     ANISE
                         How do you know this?

               
                                     TEAL'C
                         In communion with my own symbiote. It 
                         is a vision my symbiote chose to share.
 
                         
               
                                     ANISE
                         Why?

               
                                     TEAL'C
                         To demonstrate Goa'uld hatred and superiority.
 
                         
               
                                     ANISE
                         Still, if that is your proof.

               
                                     TEAL'C
                         We found Goa'uld blood in SHO'NAC'S 
                         bloodstream and trace amounts on her 
                         hands. Confirming my vision!
 
               
                                     ANISE
                         And so you have come to extract revenge?
 
                         
               
                                     TEAL'C (ANGRILY)
                         I have!

               
                                     ANISE
                         I'm sorry, we cannot allow you. (They 
                         look at each other. TEAL'C is furious. 
                         Suddenly he lunges at the Tok'ra next 
                         to him, knocks hi over and runs from 
                         the room to seek out TANITH. ) Stop 
                         him!
 
               
               TOK'RA CORRIDOR

               
               We see TEAL'C knocking down Tok'ra guards as he runs down the 
               corridor frantically. He is finally stopped by five Tok'ra and 
               yells at them in Goa' uld. O'NEILL runs after him with his gun 
               ready. He kneels down by a distraught TEAL'C.
 
               
                                     O'NEILL
                         TEAL'C, we'll get the Goa'uld out of 
                         the host.
 
               
               ANISE approaches.

               
                                     ANISE
                         No! He will be infinitely more valuable 
                         to us if we do not.
 
               
               TEAL'C and O'NEILL look at her suspiciously.

               
                                     O'NEILL
                         You knew!

               
               FREYA (Host mode) We suspected, but only after her death. TEAL'C 
               we truly had hoped SHO'NAC had succeeded but if we allow TANITH 
               to believe he has deceived us we will be able to use that against 
               the Goa'uld.
 
               
               TEAL'C (still being restrained) Disinformation.

               
                                     FREYA
                         Yes, if we control what he sees and 
                         hears the Goa'uld will never know our 
                         true intentions. We will be able to 
                         use that advantage for months. When 
                         TANITH no longer serves a useful purpose 
                         we will extract what Goa'uld secrets 
                         we can in other ways.
 
               
               
                                     ANISE
                         (The trmpy, bitchy snake is back!) He 
                         knew well the risks. When we have learned 
                         all we can we plan to remove the Goa'uld. 
                         We are fighting a war for our very existence. 
                         I make no apologies for the means. (TEAL'C 
                         and O' NEILL stare at her. ) (to Tok'ra 
                         guards) Release him.
 
               
               The guards let TEAL'C go and he stands clearly very angry.

               
               TANITHS CHAMBERS

               
               We see TEAL'C enter with O'NEILL and ANISE following. TANITH 
               is in the room. TEAL'C walks up to him with a grim look on his

                         (Snake mode) Hello TEAL'C. You must 
                         feel the pain of SHO' NAC'S death as 
                         deeply as I do. It is a terrible loss 
                         to both of us and has been difficult.Why 
                         have you come to see me?
 
               
                                     TEAL'C
                         To look upon you and know that SHO'NAC'S 
                         sacrifice will not be in vain.
 
               
                                     TANITH
                         You have my promise. I hope one day 
                         we will meet again TEAL'C and together 
                         remember she who meant so much to both 
                         of us.
 
               
                                     TEAL'C
                         We will meet again. (He bows his head) 
                         You have my promise.
