Yeah. That's almost enough
for the Olympics.
Let's get you some dinner.

Woo.
Hey, how was it?
We are in the presence
of a future Olympian.
Just guess my time.
Okay. Five...

- Right?
- That's my best.
We made that.
Did you know we made you?
- Okay.

- I know.
- Okay.
Go take a shower.
I'm making breakfast for dinner.

Oh, fuck. [EXHALES]

- I gotta catch him on a good day.
- He's in a bad mood.

- You just have to sit him down.
- Okay, I hear you, all right?
Brian, I'm looking for work too, but...
[CLEARS THROAT]

- Hey.

Hey, get milk, too, okay?

[LAUGHS]
All right. I'm going in.
You staying? Or are you going?

You say, "Hey"
Hey. Can you bring me something?
I'll think about it.
I said, "Hey"
"I'm all right"
Every time I turn around

[NAOMI] Logan?
Yeah?
The Kellmans are leaving.
Okay.
Are you guys gonna stay here?
I can't afford the rent.
With me being out of work and now...
You should stay at our mountain house.
- No.
- No, I'm serious, Naomi.
I mean, it's just sitting there, and...
You know that Bruce won't have
a problem with it.
I want to help.
I thought you guys were selling...
We are, but...
You just have to leave for a bit
on Sundays during open houses.
- It's nothing.
- I don't know, Ally.
- Having people living there is not...
- It'll be fine.
Okay? You can look after the place.
Logan would kill me if I pulled him
out of school right now.
Okay, look, it's just until
you get back on your feet.
And you'll come back.
I just can't believe it.
He's dead.
Okay.

Can you pass me my phone?
It's at your feet.

Please tell me he's okay.
[BREATHING HEAVILY]

Hey, let's just... let's just go.
What?
I could have killed him.

It's just the altitude.
Oh, shit.

You must be Logan.
Hi?
Oh, and hold on...
Naomi.
- I'm sorry?
- Oh, forgive me. I'm Martha.
Bruce and Allison's neighbor.
She told me her sisterand nephew
were coming in.
She emailed me a picture,
so I knew exactly who you two were.
Oh, okay.
So sorry for what happened
to your husband.
Allison told me all about it.
So gruesome.
You must miss him dearly.
Yeah, we... we do.
I lost my husband a few years back.
Not a day goes by
that I don't feel the void.
- Mom, should we...
- Oh. Oh, yes.
I won't keep you any longer.
If you need anything,
my house is just west through
the woods. You can't miss it.
Thank you. [CLEARS THROAT]
It's very kind of you.
It's always nice to know
you have someone nearby.
The quiet out here can get real loud.
Buh-bye now.
[NAOMI] You okay?
Yeah.

Oh. Whoa.
[NAOMI] Yeah.
Leave it to Ally to have
the biggest house on the mountain.
How have we never been here before?
It's fucking huge.

It is huge.
Okay. Let's go.

Ed is gonna be running the show today,
which means he will turn off
all the lights, he'll lock up.
And Ed, don't forget
to leave the key under the mat.
Got it.
Oh, okay.
- And do I need to do...
- Oh, God, no, no.
You don't have to do a thing,
except one:
Do not come back here until after five,
because we do not want to upset
any potential buyers.
- Mom, why didn't you wake me up?
- Oh, sorry.
- I got a call and then I didn't...
- They scared the hell out of me.
Ed, make his bed.
You two really have to get going.
Really. Now.

Welcome.
And if you have any further questions
today, just sign in right there,

take a cookie, look around,

[NAOMI] So, why would she knock?
She's nuts.
Maybe she was lost.
I just don't think the people up here
know what privacy is.
Excuse me? Your card was declined.
Do you have another one we could use?
Oh.
Uh, you know what?
I'll just use cash.
Okay.
Here. I-I got it.
No. Honey, you don't even...
It's birthday money.

- Thanks.

Aunt Allison.
It's okay.
Thank you.

Uh, if you won the lottery...
what would you do with the winnings?
I don't wanna play.
Come on.
Amuse me.
Fine. Uh...
I'd...
I'd pay off our debt.
Okay.
We're not that bad off.
But I would let you.
I'd buy us a new house back home.
- Can we have a pool?
- And a track.
I'd go to the Olympics in Japan.
- Can I come with you?
- Yeah. First class.
Other than that, I'd probably
just give the rest to you.
No.
I don't need it. You...
You'd probably spend it
on things that matter.
Well, I personally think that...
your dream of going to the Olympics
and owning a home
with the biggest backyard ever
are things that matter.
Thanks.
Okay. My turn.
Debt.
And then I think I would...
start doing photography again.
- Really?
- Yeah. I think so. I used to love it.
You should...
You should start again now.
- Please.
- You should.
You don't have to win the lottery
to do that.
Now you sound like your dad.

Mm-hmm. I have noticed.
It's good to see some new faces.

I just mean the mountain folk

Whereabouts are you from?

Hey, buddy. How you doing?
Mom?

You didn't have to be rude.

Logan...
He was just talking to me.
I was being friendly.
Are we allowed to go in yet?
Yeah.
Said it was over at five.
- [LOGAN] There's no key.
- [NAOMI] What? Is it unlocked?
Hello?
[DOOR CLOSES]
Oh, Jesus!
- Oh!
- Did you not... did you not hear us?
Sorry. I was just locking everything up.
We ran long.
Uh, Jonie's picking me up right now,
so I, uh...
I'm rushing, but your keys...
I left them right there,
and, um, that should be everything.
Okay? So, um... have... have a great night.
Thank you.
Turn on the light.
Mom.
Have you ever thought about
how, like, weird open houses are?
What?
I mean, you give your keys
to someone you hardly know,
they stand in one room and welcome in
a bunch of complete strangers,
and those people
just roam around the house.
And the realtor doesn't check the house
when it's done, right?
They just... turn the lights off and go?
Okay, well, now I'm not
gonna sleep tonight.
Maybe you shouldn't sleep tonight.
Stop.

Maybe you ran more than a mile.
No, I mapped it out.
Are you sure you started

You can do it yourself if you want.
Did you find your phone yet?
No, it's gone.
Well, it's not gone.
It has to be somewhere.

No, no need to apologize. I can relate.

Well, this is my sister's house.
We're just staying here for a bit.
Lucky us.
Yeah. Um, you could call the realtors.
They're the ones that set up the showings.
Got it. Thank you.
I'll do that.
You know what?
While we're here...
would there be any way at all
I can just peek inside?
- So you looking to move?
- Thinking about it.
I'd kill for this kind of privacy.
I don't think I caught your name.

So nice to see it lived in again.
I can't tell you how sad I was
when I saw that "For Sale" sign go up.
It's definitely a beautiful home.
I'd feel awkward if I didn't tell you...
We came to the open house yesterday.
We just wanted to see the place
one last time
before some stranger snatches it up.
Oh, okay. Yeah...
Oh, I almost forgot.
I do that a lot these days.
Uh... I brought you banana bread.
You and Logan are gonna love it.

My husband can't wait

Yeah.

She got Alzheimer's a few months back,

Oh.
I must've left it down there

You just went to check the pilot
last night.
What's your point?
And then I found this...
in the trash.
No. I didn't do that.
Have you been messing with me?
Have I been messing with you?

No, I'm not an idiot, Logan.
First the basement door,
and then the water heater, and now this?
What you talking about?
Is it because you're pissed at me?
I don't know.
Because I have so much on my plate
right now that I can't deal with you too.
I didn't do anything, Mom.
You're completely fucking insane.
- Excuse me?
- Just get out of my room.
- No. What'd you say?

No! You do not get to talk to me
like that. I am your mother,
and I'm allowed to be upset.
I know this sucks.
I know it's not what you wanted,
'cause guess what?
It's not what I wanted either.
So grow up, Logan.
I fucking hate you.
All you do is put your shit

Dad's gone, and you don't even care.
He died in front of me.You haven't
asked me one time if I'm okay.
You dragged me out of school,
brought us to this shitty town.
You don't care if I'm okay with it.
We wouldn't be in this situation
if Dad was still here.
Wanna be an adult and know the truth?
Your father is the exact reason
that we are in this situation.

It's definitely creepy,

Mom...
Uh, well, we had an open house here
a few days ago,
so maybe someone found
a spare key laying around, or...
Or maybe someone stayed.
I know it sounds stupid, but other things
have happened before this.
Things moving from one room to another.
Weird phone calls.
From anyone in particular?
No. No one would respond.
Don't look at her. I'm not lying.
Okay, look.
I know that we probably sound
like the crazy new people in town,
but this is my sister's house, and we're
supposed to be taking care of it, so...
Look, I understand the fear
in these situations.
Okay? I do.
But it's likely the front door was
unlocked and some kids snuck in.
Are you kidding me?
Look at this.
You think some kids did this?
It's not uncommon. Okay?
Kids get bored. They do weird things.
They were probably trying to scare
the newcomers.
Okay. [CLEARS THROAT]

You wanna stay in here tonight?
Sure.
What is this?
It's just the guy from the store.
He gave it to me
in case we ever needed anything.
He was just being friendly.
You can throw it out if you want.
I don't care.
I'm gonna go brush my teeth.
Okay.

Logan?
[DOORBELL RINGS]
Hey.
Chris. What are you doing here?
[LOGAN] Uh, Mom.
It's okay. I called him.
The cops weren't worried at all, huh?
No.
- They said some kids probably did it.
- Well, that's possible.
A lot of them are assholes up here.
It didn't feel like kids.
Oh, what did it feel like?
Like...
personal.
Like someone had been here before.
I don't know. Maybe I'm... maybe I'm crazy.
Well, it's just the two of you
up here, huh?
Yeah.
[LOCKS DOOR]
Anything?
All clear.
Thank you.
Yeah.
- Hey.
- Oh.
- Appreciate it.
- Yeah. Need anything else?
Uh, no, I'm good, buddy.
Yeah. Go get some rest.
Hey, thank you for doing this.
Yeah. Not a problem.
Look, this place is weird sometimes.
Yeah, it took me a while
to get used to it, too.
I'm sure it's nothing, but, uh...
I'll be here.
I'm sorry, um...
- if I was rude before. I just...
- No, no, no, no. No need to explain, man.
We're all good.
- Night.
- Night.

What did he do?
What did he do to you?
I should have listened to you.
Where's Chris?
He's dead.
What? Oh, my God.
Oh, no.
He's gonna come back.
We have to get out.
We're gonna get out. Okay?
Yeah, yeah.
[NAOMI WHIMPERS]

["RIP VAN WINKLE" PLAYING]
You're sleeping all your moments away
I'm counting every breath
That you take
You've been snoozing 20 years
And lengthening that beard
You whittled a squirrel for me
And counted lemons on your tree
And every time I turn around
And have given up for good
You say, "Hey"
[PHONE DISCONNECT TONE]
"It'll be all right"
I said, "Hey"
"I'm all right"
And every time I turn around
And have given up for good
You're haunted by the things
That you've seen
I know they give you terrible dreams
We all know you'll wake up soon
And rattle off that dust
You can spot a hawk a mile away
Cursing all those old blue jays
But every time I turn around
No.
And have given up for good

I thought you'd blow up my phone
AT 5:00 a.m., and I'd call you
I watched the mountains and trees
Blue, foggy breeze surrounds you
Thought it was you
That I saw there
Hands reaching out there
You're farther
Evanesce
Evanesce
You were away for a while
I was too long to follow
Hands reaching in there
You're farther
