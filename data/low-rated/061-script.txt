- Excuse me.
- Bless you.
- You know...

Did you know that pilgrims
used to think sneezing
meant you were
expelling demons?
- What?
- (LAUGHS) That's why I never sneeze.
I want to keep them all
- in my soul.
- Your soul.
If I had one.
WREN: Twitter poll.
If you could stay one age
forever, what would it be?
- Easy. 21.
- No way. I'd be 10.
Oh, no, 10 was
the worst, man.
I say, 30. It's like
the height of sophistication.
- You?
- What about the age we are right now?
I'd like to stay
like this forever.
Seriously? I mean,
what's wrong with you?
Okay, fine.
The age we are right now,
but we could all live
in a house together.
Okay, fine.
But without Wren, though?
Yeah, obviously,
that goes without saying.
Super funny.
Like, whoa.
WREN: (IN AUSTRALIAN ACCENT) Guys, the
dudebros in their natural habitat.
Let's observe, shall we?
(IN NORMAL VOICE) Hey, Tom!
So, what's the plan tonight?
- Big plans...
- Hey.
- It's top secret.
- Oh, I see. A circle jerk?
(GIRLS LAUGH)
- Hey, Chloe.
- Hey, Kyle.
So, what's the big secret?
I mean, I could tell you,
- but then, I'd have to kill you.
- (LAUGHS)
- Okay, buddy.
- Yeah.
Yeah. It's very intriguing.
You guys, I got to go get my
sister, but I love you. Bye.
WREN: See you later.
I'll pick you up tonight.
- I'm sorry.
- Bye. It's okay.
(SCHOOL BELL RINGING)
Bumped into
Coach Sanders today.
Said your 1,600-meter time
is really improving.
All that training's
paying off.
Nice work, sweetheart.
Did you tell them Delores
Constantino quit the team?
Why?
She's pregnant.
What is she
planning to do, now?
She's gonna drop out,
and keep the baby.
I assume Wren is gonna be
at Katie's tonight?
Yeah. So?
So, what are you guys
gonna do?
You know, drink a lot of
vodka, and meet guys online.
Funny. Very funny.
- Can I come?
- Not a chance.
- You said I could come next time.
- I lied.
(DOORBELL RINGING)
- Hey.
- Hey.
Do you think I could
hang out with you guys?
Uh, yeah,
not tonight, grasshopper.
Sorry. Maybe next time.
Oh, I wore the shirt
you gave me to school.
Got sent
to the principal's office.
- Well done, man. Yes.
- Hey.
- WREN: Hey.
- Goodbye.
Bye.
Love me.
Bye, Lizzie.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

Just another exciting Friday
night at the Jensens.

- WREN: No? Oh?
Yeah, it's girl gaze porn.
- (POP MUSIC PLAYING)
- You know how they have POV porn?
- Yeah.
- This one's from our perspective.
- I don't want to see that.
- KATIE: For sure.
- (LAUGHING)
- Oh, my God.
Do you think she likes that?
- Oh, my God!
- No!
Oh, God! Once you see it,
you just can't unsee it.

What the hell is he doing?
He's probably just

- Sometimes, I wish I could just leave.
- WREN: I know.
Why don't we just all leave? Get
out of this stupid town together.
Where would we go?
I have friends in Paris. We
could totally stay with them.
What friends?
You've never been to Paris.
- My mom has friends there, idiot.
- Don't I wish.
I'll just be stuck here
forever, in this shithole.
(HALLIE GROANS)
- (GIRLS LAUGHING)
- (THUDDING OVERHEAD)
WREN: Seriously! No, I think you and
Carl would make an adorable couple.
It's "Kyle,"
and I don't like him.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Whatever, you know.
But we all know
that you wish you were
at their little secret
sausage fest right now.
No.
But I do know
what their secret is.
WREN: Oh, yeah? Do tell.
So, they're getting together
tonight at Tom's house
in his garage,
to summon Slender Man.
- Creepy.
- Who's Slender Man?
Yeah, he's the guy who makes
all those kids disappear.
Why have I not heard of this?
That's a much
longer conversation.
- Listen.
- Troll...
"Slender Man can manifest
in a variety of forms.
"Certain accounts speak
of a hypnotic power
"that renders his victims
helpless to stop themselves
"from walking into
waiting arms.
"While his origins and motives
are completely unknown,
"he preys upon innocent youth.
"Once you see him, you're his.
"Some he takes,
some he doesn't.
"Nobody knows why he takes who he
takes, or why he leaves who he leaves.
"But the ones he leaves behind
are messed up forever."
All right, here it is.
"How to summon Slender Man."
- Guys, we so have to do this.
- CHLOE: We actually don't.
Actually.
If they're doing it,
we're doing it.
KATIE: This feels wrong.
This feels like
Russian malware-y
virus-type shit.
Come on,
don't be such a wuss.
"Those who hear
the three bells toll
"accept his invitation.
"When you hear the first,
you must close your eyes,
"keeping words unspoken.
"If one wants to hear,
you must listen closely,
"for they are soft
and distant.
"With eyes still closed
and mind wide open,
"clear your thoughts
and await the second,
"opening your eyes only once
you've heard the third."

TOUR GUIDE:
This burial ground dates back
all the way
to the Revolutionary War,
which was 1775 to 1783.
In 2004, it was put on the National
Registry of Historical Sites,
which was very exciting.
Initially, all of this land
belonged to Thomas Clifton,
who left it to the town of
Winsford in his will in 1674.
(CRACKLING)
You guys, I threw up twice this
morning, before I got on the bus.

Ha. That's hilarious, and also,

Mmm-mmm.
Have you?

Yeah, she still hasn't
answered any of my texts.

NEWS ANCHOR: (ON TABLET) Teenager Katie
Jensen was last seen on Wednesday,
during a school field trip to
the historic Clifton Cemetery.
As of now,
local police have no leads,
but are questioning friends
and family members
in hopes of gaining insight into
the reason for her disappearance.
Citizens with any information are being
urged to contact local authorities.
You should tell me
what really happened to Katie.
We never keep secrets
from each other.
How would you know? You don't know that.
Do your homework.
Come on,
I don't want to talk about it.
It was a boy, right? You think I'll tell?
I'd never tell.
You'd totally tell.
Not Mom and Dad.
Totally Mom and Dad.
Maybe.
Definitely, but you get points
for honesty.
So, tell me.
You don't know. Do you?
Just do your work, Lizzie.
- Hallie.
- Lizzie.
Fine.
I could stay home alone,
you know. I'm old enough.
Physical age, maybe.
(DOOR OPENING)
Did you hear that?
Hey, Mom? Dad!

MAN: Katie.

Katie, you here?
(MAN CRYING)
Mr. Jensen?
Where's my daughter?
I don't know.
- Is Katie here? Are you hiding her?
- No.
I don't know where she is.
It's all your fault.
She was never
into this stuff.
- All this occult stuff.
- Hallie?
Lizzie, stay back.
- Where is she?
- I don't know.
- Where is she?
- No! Don't! Hallie!
- Where is my daughter?
- Hallie!
- Lizzie!

(HALLIE AND LIZZIE SCREAM)
Let's go.
(LIZZIE SOBBING)

- Hey, hey, hey!
HALLIE'S DAD:
You hear me, Jensen?
(INAUDIBLE)
Did you guys really try
and summon Slender Man?
Why?
We chickened out.
(BELL RINGING)
You chickened out.
- I chickened out?
- You chickened out.
- I remember you being the one...
- He chickened out.
...that chickened out.
Katie's father broke into
my house last night.
- What?
- What?
He said something about Katie
being into the occult,
and then he blamed us
for getting her into it.
Wait, what did he mean about
Katie being into the occult?
I don't know.
He was so wasted.
This could be
the next wrinkle in the story.
I don't want
to play this game.
It's not a game.
Katie's missing.
Yeah, and we know things
that nobody else knows.
What do we know?
We know that
she watched that video.
Look, we all watched that video.
It didn't do anything.
When are we gonna admit
that Katie was kidnapped?
Somebody has her.
Yeah, but when we watched that
video, it affected all of us.
Something happened.
I felt it.
- I didn't see anything.
- I didn't see anything, either.
Didn't say I saw it.
I said I felt it.
And I think you did, too.
And I'm damn sure
that Katie felt it,
and that's why
she disappeared!
This is a bad idea.
It's just a quick
look around, okay?
Plus, you know what, he's probably
totally passed out by now.
I don't know, I just feel like
there's got to be something.
- You know, like a clue, maybe, or...
- You're crazy.
You don't realize
how he was last night.
CHLOE: The back door is always unlocked
for when Katie gets home late.
Just saying.
Great. Then let's go.
Told ya.
(SNORING)
(DOORBELL RINGS)
Wren?
Hi. Hi, Mr. Jensen.
What are you doing here?
Well, I just wanted
to come down
and see if there was anything
that I could do, if I could help
in any way?
Anything I could do.
I miss her.
People just don't disappear.
You want to come in?
That'd be great.
She's really gone.
The police must have
taken her laptop.
HALLIE: What is all this?
(WHISPERING) She used to keep
cigarettes and stuff in here.
Let's just take it.
(TYPING)
HALLIE: Okay. Here's the last
site she visited.
What am I looking at?
HALLIE: Here, click it.
Okay.
(CHILDREN GIGGLING)
(GIGGLES ECHOING)
Oh, shit.
All these, like, town names,
and dates and stuff.
Click another one.
BOY 1: Okay, guys. Let's go.
I am Slender Man.
- BOY 1: Dude. (SHUSHING)
- BOY 2: Guys, guys.
BOY 1: Whoa, whoa.
What is that? What is that?
I'm so scared. I'm so...
(PANTING)
BOY 1: Go, go, go!
- BOY 2: Oh, God!
- BOY 1: Dude, he's there!
- I can't...
- (SCREAMING)
- It's him.
- I don't like this.
- Wait, look.
- What?
AleeyKat93.
Jeez.
They went back and forth,
like, a gazillion times.
"I knew he was there
before I saw him."
It's like they're
comparing experiences.
Wait, look.
Katie posted a video.
HALLIE: Look, it's from the
night before she disappeared.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
(GASPING)
- What was that?
- What did you see?
What did you see?
- I don't know, I...
- I don't know, either.
- WREN: I talked to her.
- HALLIE: Who?
AleeyKat93.
It was that girl that Katie was
talking to on that website.
I messaged her,
and she replied.
You went back
on that website?
She told me everything. He gets
in your head like a virus.
What kind of virus?
Like a computer virus
that infects your hard drive,
but instead of your
hard drive, it's your brain.
- Wren, you're gonna need to slow down...
- No, listen to me.
Once the virus takes hold,
he's got you. It's done.
Some he haunts,
some he drives mad.
- And others, he takes, like...
- Like what?
Katie.
Listen, I know that this...
This is gonna sound crazy,
but AleeyKat said we can
"unveil ourselves."
Okay, if we just surrender
something to him
that has personal meaning,
something that we truly love.
What the hell does that mean?
We can contact Slender Man.
Why would we do that?
To get Katie back. Hello?
Katie did it, and the next
day, she was just gone.
Okay, Katie asked Slender Man
- to take her?
- Yes.
Why would she do that?
I don't know. You know, maybe
she had an alcoholic father,
and maybe she hated her life,
and maybe she talked about
running away all the time,
you know?
Guys, the police have
no leads.
Right? Right?
So, even if the odds
are a million-to-one
that any of this is real,
or that...
That he has anything to do
with Katie's disappearance,
we owe it to her to try.
WREN: This should work.
I guess that I'll...
Go first, then.
I... (CHUCKLES)
I made this in pottery class,
when I was five.
This is a picture of me
and my dad.
It's the only one I have
where we're together.
It was taken a few months
before he died.
My grandma made this
when Lizzie was born.
She died eight years ago.
(GRUNTS)
Surprised you didn't bring one
of your trophies, or medals.
You said it had to be
something I cared about, so...
I brought this.
Lights out.
Okay, so...
Listen, once we ask
for Katie's return,
we have to keep these
blindfolds on, all right?
AleeyKat said not to look
in his face.
If you do,
you're messed up forever.
It's different for everyone, but it
only ends in insanity, or death.
Okay.
Okay, hold my hand, hold my hand.
You hold her hand, too, okay?
We all have to hold hands.
How long do you think
we're gonna give this?
As long as it takes.
(FOREST QUIETS)
Keep your blindfolds on.

Chloe, I told you not to
take your blindfold off.

I just got scared. Okay?
Something happened, and she knows it.
Something happened back there!
You're right. We didn't get Katie back.

- No, no, no.
Look at me. I found proof.
I found the proof. Right?
Look, look, look,
I understand.
I understand now, what AleeyKat
was trying to tell me.
It's proof. Read this.
Read this with me.
Okay, it says, "paranormal
contact with bioelectric systems
"often results
in a symbiotic relationship.
"The effects on host organisms have
been well documented and manifest
"in various forms, such as..."
- Wren. Wren. Calm down.

I thought I saw something
in the trees.
It was him.
And, what about Chloe?
Have you talked to her?
I don't know. I've called her house, and
her mom keeps telling me she's sick.
Last time I called, she pretty much
flat out told me to stay away.
We need to go there right now.
Wren, there's nothing
we can do, and I have track.
- I can't just leave.
- Track?
I thought you didn't care
about track anymore.
I thought you cared
about Chloe.

Chloe.
Chloe. Wake up.
HALLIE: What the hell
was that?
I don't know, but I told...
I knew that she saw his face
in the woods, you know?
I knew that she was
lying, too. I knew that.
I don't want to
do this anymore.
Yeah, I don't, either.
But I'm stuck in it.
And you are, too.
You just don't realize it yet.
Don't look at me like that.
I'm not doing a "thing."
All right.
"All right"?
Yeah, don't say "All right."
We only watched
the website video.
But Chloe,
she saw him in the woods.
- Wren, I can't keep...
- Read the book that I showed you.
You will see the body count, okay?
Thousands of disappearances.
Search parties, faces on milk cartons.
I'm not making this shit up.
And it all happened
exactly like AleeyKat said.
It's probably some 50-year-old dude
living in his parents' basement,
getting off on e-mailing
teenage girls every day.
Did you ever think of that?
Did you?
So, you think that you can
just go back to real life?
Yeah, I do. In fact,
I have a real-life date
with real-life Tom tonight.
In real life.
He's not gonna stop!
And going on a date
with fucking Abercrombie Tom
is not gonna change anything!
You know I'm right!
You know I'm right.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Sorry I'm late.
- No worries. Come on in.
- Thanks.
I thought I had
the wrong house
because there weren't any cars
in the driveway.
Yeah, my dad's at this business thing,
and Mom's at her book club, so...
So, nobody's home?
No, it's just us.
Is that okay?
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
I didn't know you were
such a music geek.
Hmm.

Have you told
anyone else about this?
(SIGHS)
If Katie was on some weird
Slender Man website, then
who knows who she met?
I mean...
Probably some weird guy
in a van, you know?
I hate to say it.
(SIGHS)
Is this it?
- No, don't.
- (SCOFFS) Come on.
Tom, please.
You can't go on that site.
- It's just a video.
- It's not just a video.
Promise me you won't
ever watch that video.
Tom, I'm serious.
Please promise.
Okay. Okay, I promise.
Really.
I need to go.
All right, first, let's all
take a moment to observe...
- Tom. Hey.
- ...the exterior anatomy here.
Tom? Tom.
Hey. Are you okay?
Now, you'll notice that the cornea
looks a little cloudy and bluish.
That happens naturally because
of the preservation process.
So, very carefully,
with your scalpels,
I want you to make a slice right through
the sclera as evenly as you can.
That's gonna separate the
anterior features of the eye.

Blood tests are negative.
She's gonna be fine.
They think it was just
some kind of panic attack.
They want to keep her to monitor
her for at least another day.

Lizzie, please.

I'm sorry.
You're sorry? That's it? That's my sister!
Why would you do that?
She came to me.
- Wren, she's in the hospital!
- She came to me.
It was before I knew.
To get Lizzie back,
to make him stop,
you can't just
give him something you love.
It's not enough.

LIZZIE: Hallie, Katie,
Chloe, Wren.
There's almost
always a pattern.
He only shows himself
just enough to infect us.
The more fear he creates,
the more fascinated we get.
We talk and write about him,
share pictures, click on links,
Photoshop images.
That's how a virus works.
That's how it spreads.
And some people cross the line
and actually seek him out,
like my sister
and her friends did.
And those messed-up people
go out and do messed-up things
that become more stories
for people to tell.
It's all spreading his word.
You know?
(STUDENTS CHATTERING)
MAN 1: We know
he abducts people.
MAN 2: I started getting
a ringing in my ears.
(SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE)
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
MAN 3: It's the thing
that we fear.
MAN 4: There'd been reports of strange
lights coming from the woods.
MAN 5: Viral nature of his
ever-expanding reach and influence.
I keep having nightmares
about his pale face.
REPORTER: Pictures include variations
of a thin man with a blanked-out face.
MAN 6: He seduces them.
